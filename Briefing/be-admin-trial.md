# Admin trial

As an Exchange Administrator or a Global Administrator for your organization, you are eligible to receive the Briefing email before people in your organization starts receiving it.

As an admin, this is your opportunity to experience the value of the Briefing email and familiarize yourself with its functionality before the rest of your organization sees it.

First, you'll get a one-time welcome email that explains what the Briefing email is, key privacy and security information, and links to helpful resources for managing a Briefing rollout.

For the next two weeks starting with the welcome email, you're eligible to get a Briefing email on days that you have actionable tasks. Your Briefing will look and function exactly how it will for everyone in your organization so you get a good feel for what they will see and experience.

If you keep the Briefing email on for your organization, your end users will start receiving the Briefing email two weeks after you received the welcome email.

## Key considerations

* Only admins with an English language mailbox as configured in Outlook are eligible to receive the welcome email and the two-week preview of Briefing.
* Not all admins in an organization will get the welcome email and have a two-week preview before the rest of the organization starts receiving the Briefing email. For example, if all admins in your organization have a mailbox language set to something other than English and other people do have English language mailboxes, those admins are not eligible to receive the email but the other people are and will start receiving the Briefing after the two-week preview period.
* If Cortana has no suggestions for you, you will not receive the Briefing email. You could receive the welcome email and not receive a Briefing email during the two-week preview period. The rest of your organization will start getting the Briefing email 14 days after you got the welcome email, regardless of how many Briefing emails you received.
* If you turn off the Briefing for yourself or your organization, you will not receive the welcome email or the two-week preview.
