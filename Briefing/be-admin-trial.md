# Initial admin trial

As an Exchange Administrator or a Global Administrator for your organization, you are eligible to receive the Briefing email before people in your organization receives it.

As an admin, this is your opportunity to experience the value of the Briefing email and familiarize yourself with its functionality before the rest of your organization gets it.

First, you'll get a one-time welcome email that explains what the Briefing email is, key privacy and security information, and links to helpful resources for managing a Briefing rollout.

For the next weeks after the welcome email, you'll get a Briefing email on days that you have actionable tasks.
