# Initial admin trial

As an Exchange Administrator or a Global Administrator for your organization, you are eligible to receive the Briefing email before it is introduced to other people in your organization.

As an admin, this is your opportunity to experience the value of the Briefing email and familiarize yourself with its functionality before it is sent to the rest of your organization.

First, you will get a one-time welcome email that explains what the Briefing email is, key privacy and security information, and links to helpful resources for managing a Briefing rollout.

You'll then get a Briefing email for the next two weeks after the welcome email, assuming you have actionable tasks for that day.
