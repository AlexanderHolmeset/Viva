# Plan time for the week

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you'll see a **Make time for what's important** section in your first Briefing email for the week.

Select **Book** next one or more of the following to schedule it for the week:

* **Focus time** - Suggests up to two-hour blocks of time available on your calendar for uninterrupted focused work. When scheduled, your status shows as "focusing" and notifications are silenced.
* **Email catch-up** - Suggests a 30-minute block of time to catch up on email and chats.
* **Mental breaks** - Suggests a 15-minute block of time twice a day to disconnect and recharge.
* **Learning** - Suggests up to a two-hour block of time to learn a new skill and grow your career.

This section will also reference and list any already scheduled time in your calendar for these activities.

In the following example, youâ€™d select **Book** for **Email catch-up** to schedule you as **busy** during that time each day during your work week.
