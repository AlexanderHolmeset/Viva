# Prepare for today's meetings

In this section of your Briefing email, you’ll see tasks you might want to do to help prepare for today’s meetings. You can select the meeting heading to open the meeting details or select a document that’s related to the upcoming meeting to open and view it.

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you can also do the following:

* If you got what you needed or you've already followed up on this item, select **Done**.
* Or if the suggestion isn’t related or actionable, select **Not related** or **Not a task** to help improve future suggestions.

In the following example, you’d select **Weekly PM meeting** to open the meeting details or select the related **Status update** document to open and view it.
