# Settings

You can change your personal settings for the Briefing email to set what time of day you receive the Briefing in your mailbox or to unsubscribe from it. These settings override or take precedence over what the admin sets up for your Briefing email.

**To update settings**

1. Near the end of any Briefing email, select **Settings** or go to [https://cortana.office.com/briefing](https://cortana.office.com/briefing).
2. In **Settings**, you can change the following:

   * To unsubscribe, select **On** to turn it **Off**.
   * In **When would you like to receive this email**, select the time of day you want to receive it, and then select **Save**.
