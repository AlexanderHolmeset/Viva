# Frequently asked questions for the Briefing email

## For IT admins

### Q1. Who will get the email?

A1. Everyone in your Office 365 tenant with an English (United States) language Exchange Online mailbox will receive the email (if they have actionable tasks).

### Q2. How can I manage who receives the email?  

A2. The Briefing email is on by default. You can use [PowerShell](be-admin.md) to enable/disable the Briefing email for individual users. You can set the default opt-in or opt-out option at the tenant level in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Users can also individually opt out by simply selecting the *Unsubscribe* link at the end of a Briefing email.

### Q3. Does the Briefing email comply with GDPR?

A3. Yes. Microsoft complies with GDPR requirements when providing the Briefing email.

### Q4. Can users see information about other users in the Briefing email?

A4. The Briefing email only includes existing information that’s already available in the user’s mailbox. It summarizes documents, emails, and meetings to make it easier for the user to find what’s most important for their day ahead. Users cannot see any new information about other users that wasn’t already available in their mailboxes.  

### Q5. I previously disabled Cortana Optional Connected Experiences for my organization. Do I need to enable preexisting Cortana experiences again for my users to receive the Briefing email?  

A5. No, the Briefing email is a new service. Users will still receive the Briefing email even if you previously disabled “Cortana Optional Connected Experiences” for your organization. Previous Cortana experiences, such as for weather, news, and traffic updates, are primarily for consumers. New Cortana experiences, such as Briefing and Play My Emails, are primarily for employees in organizations. The Briefing email has IT management capabilities and configurable controls that enable you to address legal needs and policies regarding privacy and use of employee data for your organization.  

## For Briefing users

### Q1. Who does the email come from?  

A1. The subject line is “Your daily briefing” and the sender is cortana@microsoft.com with a friendly name of “Cortana.”

### Q2. How often does the email come?  

A2. One time per workday (as set in Outlook) when you have actions needed to prepare for a meeting or in response to an email. The email is not sent when you have no actionable items.

### Q3. If I have no tasks or meetings, will I still receive a Briefing email?  

A3. No, you will never be sent an empty email with no content.

### Q4. Can I stop receiving these emails?  

A4. You can unsubscribe from the email with one click in the email footer.

### Q5. Can my manager, administrator, or anyone else at my organization see what’s in my Briefing email?

A5. No, the Briefing email is private and for you and only you. All information in the Briefing email is from your mailbox and stored in your mailbox. Everything you see in the Briefing email is information you already have access to in your mailbox. The Briefing email just makes it easier to find items that might need attention.

### Q6. Why am I getting so many emails from Microsoft and how can I manage them?  

A6. You are only getting emails from Cortana and MyAnalytics with the purpose of helping you be more productive during your workday. MyAnalytics lets you explore your work patterns and learn ways to work smarter by providing you with personal productivity insights through weekly digest emails, a dashboard, and an Insights Outlook add-in.  

Briefing is optimized to show you the most relevant and actionable information you need for the day ahead. It provides complementary experiences to help you be your most productive self. You only get Briefing emails at the beginning of your workday if you have actionable tasks or meetings. You can opt out with the Unsubscribe link at the end of the email.
