# Make the most of your focus time

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you can use this section to schedule focus time for today’s top-priority work. Select **Book** next a suggested time to block it on your calendar as busy, which silences notifications for uninterrupted focused work.

This section will also reference and list any already scheduled focus time in today’s calendar.

In the following example, you’d select **Book** next to **3:00 PM – 4:00 PM** to schedule you as **busy** during that time on today’s calendar.
