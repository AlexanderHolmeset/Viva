# Follow up on tasks

>[!Note]
> Between September 2021 and November 2021, the personal insights that are provided in your daily briefing email will begin to reflect the Microsoft Viva brand. For more information, see [Daily briefing and MyAnalytics branding updates to reflect Microsoft Viva](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/daily-briefing-and-myanalytics-branding-updates-to-reflect/ba-p/2681246).

In the **Commitments and follow-ups** section of your Briefing, you'll see the following types of tasks:

* **Commitment** &ndash; Something that you promised or committed to do for someone else in an email.
* **Request** &ndash; Something another person asked you to do in an email.
* **Follow-up** &ndash; Something you asked for from someone else in an email.
* **To Do task** &ndash; A task that you've added to your To Do task list.

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you can also do the following:

* If the related task is already done, select **Done**.
* If you’d like to follow up on the task later, select **Remind me**. The task is automatically added to To Do and a Briefing email reminder is set for the next working day.  
* After you select **Remind me**, you can customize the task or its reminder in these ways:
   * To edit the task, select **Edit task in To Do**.
   * To choose a date on which you’d like to be reminded of the task, select **Remind me on date**.
   * To be reminded of the task in the briefing email during the following week, select **Remind me next week**.
* To remove the task from your list, select the **Delete** (trashcan) icon.

In the following example, you’d select **Done** to confirm you’ve already done the task related to **TED Talks**. Or you could select **Remind me** to get a reminder in your next day's briefing email and to view the task in To Do. After you select **Remind me**, you can further customize your management of the task by editing it in the To Do app or by selecting a reminder for another day.

Or, if you use the To Do feature, you could select **Edit task in To Do**.
