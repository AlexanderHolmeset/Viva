# Follow up on tasks

In the **Commitments and follow-ups** section of your Briefing, you'll see the following types of tasks:

* **Commitment** &ndash; Something that you promised or committed to do for someone else in an email.
* **Request** &ndash; Something another person asked you to do in an email.
* **Follow-up** &ndash; Something you asked for from someone else in an email.
* **To Do task** &ndash; A task that you've added to your To Do task list.

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you can also do the following:

* If the related task is already done, select **Done**.
* If you’d like to follow up on the task later, select **Remind me**. The task is automatically added to To Do and a Briefing email reminder is set for the next working day.  
* After you select **Remind me**, you can edit the task by selecting **Edit task in To Do** or you can select **Remind me on date** to choose a date on which you’d like to be reminded of the task.  
* To remove the task from your list, select the **Delete** (trashcan) icon.

In the following example, you’d select **Done** to confirm you’ve already done the task related to **TED Talks**. Or you could select **Remind me** to get a reminder in your next day's briefing email and to view the task in To Do. After you select remind me, you can further customize your management of the task by editing it in the To Do app or by selecting a reminder for another day.
