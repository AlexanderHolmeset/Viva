# My Team in Viva Insights

You can view manager insights on the **My Team** page in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams. Manager insights provide visibility into team collaboration patterns that are leading indicators for overall employee experience and wellbeing.

While you can also see these outcome-based insights and their related best practices in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them in Teams, the tool that you're already using for communicating during remote work, the tool you use for meeting, sharing files, and sending IMs to employees and other leaders.

## Open the My Team page

1. On the Teams app bar (the left navigation bar), select **Insights**:

2. The Home page of the Insights app opens. Notice the card in the upper right. This card displays a random insight from one of the My Team outcomes. To learn more about this insight, select the **Explore more** option on this card.

   You can also use any of the other features on this page, such as **Reflect**, **Praise**, **Stay connected**, and **Protect time**. For more information about these Home page features, see [Viva Insights Home page](/insights/viva-insights-home).

3. On the menu bar at the top of the page, select **My Team**. The My Team page opens to show the following outcomes:

   * Employee experience
   * Team effectiveness

4. Inspect the outcomes and the statistics that they show. Do you see any red flags that might cause you to take action?  

## Business outcomes

To investigate further, select one of the outcomes to see the insights for that outcome. For example, on the **Outcomes** page, select  **Employee experience** to see the **Coaching and development** insights:

## Best practices

To learn about taking action on an outcome, you can drill down another layer to see related best practices. For example, on the **Boost employee engagement** insight, select **View best practices**, which opens the panel called, **Best Practices: Increase frequency of coaching**:
