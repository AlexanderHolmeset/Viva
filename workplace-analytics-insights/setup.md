# Set up insights

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time.*

Before people in your organization can view and use Microsoft 365 Insights, your Microsoft 365 global admin needs to do the following for them:

* [Activate promotional codes](#activate-promotional-codes)
* [Assign licenses](#assign-licenses)
* [Assign roles](assign-roles.md)

This new release is currently limited to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 or E3 plan subscribers through their Microsoft service representative.

You can request access and get more information at [Microsoft Workplace Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/workplace-analytics). Select **Contact us** and complete the form to request access and get more information about Microsoft 365 Insights.

## Activate promotional codes

1. Depending on which browser you are using, on the Windows taskbar or Start menu, right-click the browser application and select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.
2. Copy the **activation code link** that Microsoft sent you for Microsoft 365 Insights, paste it into the URL section of the private or incognito browser window, and then press **Enter** to open the link.

## Assign licenses

You must be able to sign in as a global Microsoft 365 admin to use the Microsoft admin center to assign licenses to people in your organization who subscribe to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 or E3 plan whose [geo location is North America](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo#microsoft-365-multi-geo-availability).

You can assign licenses as follows:

* [Assign licenses to individual users with the Microsoft 365 admin center](assign-licenses.md)
* [Assign licenses to security groups with Azure AD](assign-licenses.md)
* [Assign licenses to users with Microsoft PowerShell](assign-licenses-pshell.md)

## Access to Insights

After assigning licenses, the data for insights might take up to a week to process and become available. After [assigning roles](assign-roles.md) and allowing for data processing, send your organization's leaders the link to [Insights](https://productivityinsights.office.com) to open and use them. Also, refer them to [Insights introduction](./intro.md) to learn more about how to use them.
