## To assign licenses

You must be able to sign in as a Microsoft 365 admin to use the Microsoft admin center to assign licenses to one or more individual users who subscribe to Microsoft or Office 365 E5 plan.

Alternatively, you can sign in as the admin to Azure Active Directory to assign licenses for Workplace Analytics insights to one or more security groups who subscribe to a Microsoft or Office 365 E5 plan.

### To assign licenses to individual users

1. In the **Microsoft admin center**, select **Active users**, and then do one of the following to assign licenses to one user or for multiple users at the same time.

   **For one user**:
   a. In **Active users**, select the user from the list.
   b. Select **Licenses and Apps**.
   c. Select the check box for **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights**.
   d. Select **Save changes**.

   **For multiple users**:
   a. In **Active users**, select the checkbox next to the users you want to assign licenses.
   b. Select the **ellipsis** (**...**) icon next to **Reset password**, and then select **Manage product licenses**.
   c. Select **Assign more**, and then select the check box for **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights**.
   d. Select **Save changes**.

2. These licenses are assigned right away to the selected users.

### To assign licenses to security groups in Azure

1. In **Microsoft Azure Active Directory**, select **Licenses** under **Manage**.
2. In **Overview**, select **All products**, and then select the check box for **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights**.
3. Select **Assign**, and then select to expand **Users and groups**.
4. Search for the group name, select it from the list, and then choose **Select**.
5. Select to expand Assignment options, confirm that both **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights** are set **On**, and then select **OK**.
6. It can take a few minutes up to 24 hours for the license assignments to update to the server, which is based on your specific server settings.

> [!Note]
> If you are assigning licenses to a group that has more people than you have licenses for, the tool will assign users as listed in the group up to the number of available licenses, and then you'll see an error message about how many in the group have licenses.
