# Set up insights

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time.*

Before people in your organization can view and use Workplace Analytics insights, your Microsoft 365 global admin needs to do the following for them:

* [Activate licenses](#activate-licenses)
* [Assign licenses](#assign-licenses)
* [Assign roles](assign-roles.md)

This new release is currently limited to Microsoft or Office 365 E5 or E3 plan subscribers through their Microsoft service representative.

You can request access and get more information at [Microsoft Workplace Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/workplace-analytics). Select **Contact us** and complete the form to request access and get more information about Workplace Analytics insights.

## Activate licenses

1. Depending on which browser you are using, on the Windows taskbar or Start menu, right-click the browser application and select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.
2. Copy the **activation code link** that Microsoft sent you for Workplace Analytics insights, paste it into the URL section of the private or incognito browser window, and then press **Enter** to open the link.

5. In **Check out** > **confirm you order** > **Microsoft Workplace Analytics insights trial**, select **Try now**.
6. When prompted in **order receipt**, select **Continue**.

## Assign licenses

You must be able to sign in as a global Microsoft 365 admin to use the Microsoft admin center to assign licenses to people in your organization who subscribe to Microsoft or Office 365 E5 or E3 plan whose [geo location is North America](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo#microsoft-365-multi-geo-availability).

You can assign licenses as follows:

* [Assign licenses to individual users with the Microsoft admin center](assign-licenses.md)
* [Assign licenses to security groups with Azure AD](assign-licenses.md)
* [Assign licenses to users with Microsoft PowerShell](assign-licenses-pshell.md)

## Access to Insights

After assigning licenses, the data for insights might take up to three days to process and become available. After [assigning roles](assign-roles.md) and allowing for data processing, send your organization's leaders the link to [Insights](https://productivityinsights.office.com) to open and use them. Also, refer them to [Insights introduction](./intro.md) to learn more about how to use them.
