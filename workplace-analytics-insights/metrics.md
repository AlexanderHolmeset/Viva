# Metrics for Workplace Analytics insights

The following describes how the metrics are calculated to support the behavioral insights for each of the business insight questions.

|Business insight question |Metric description  |
|---------|--------------------|
|Are employees getting enough time with their managers? |One-on-one time is the number of meeting hours with only an employee and their manager. To account for various meeting frequencies, the total time is calculated for each employee per month and averaged over a week. |
|Are employees working after hours? |After-hours work is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and on email outside of working hours. This uses the working hours set in the employee's Outlook calendar settings. |
|Are employees overwhelmed by email? |Employees that spend over 10 hours in email each week. Email workload is the number of hours employees spend sending and receiving email.|
|Are employees burdened by long and large meetings? |The number of employees that spend over 50 percent of their total meeting time in long or large meetings, divided by the total number of measured employees. Long meetings are those scheduled for more than an hour. Large meetings are those that involve more than eight people.|
|Do employees have time to focus? |The number of employees who have less than 20 hours each of available time for focused work, divided by the total number of measured employees. Focus time is when employees have two or more consecutive hours with no meetings. |
|Are managers connected across the company? |Manager cross-team connections are the number of departments outside their own that the manager had meaningful interactions with in the last 28 days. A meaningful interaction is defined as an email or meeting that includes two to five people. |
|Do employees collaborate across the company? |Cross-organization collaboration is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and email with at least one person outside of their own department. This insight highlights the organizations that spend more than 50 percent of their overall collaboration within their group. |
|Are influencers present across the company? |Influencers are employees who have the best connections to people across the company based on their collaboration patterns. This insight highlights the organizations that don't have sufficient representation of them, based on company and organization size. |
|Are employees sharing information quickly? |One-on-one communication is the combination of email and instant messages (IMs) sent between two employees. This insight highlights the employees that spend less than 10 percent of their one-on-one communication over Teams IM. This is calculated as the percentage of one-on-one IMs sent, divided by the total number of one-on-one IMs and emails sent. |
| Are employees building customer networks? | _External network_ is the number of people external to the company with whom the employee had at least two meaningful interactions in a month. This insight highlights employees who have had more than five connections with external people in a month. |
