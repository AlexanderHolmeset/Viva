# Assign licenses

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time.*

You must be able to sign in as a global Microsoft 365 admin to use the Microsoft admin center to [assign licenses to one or more individual users](#to-assign-licenses-to-individual-users) who subscribe to a Microsoft or Microsoft 365 E5 or E3 plan whose [Microsoft 365 datacenter geo location is North America](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo#microsoft-365-multi-geo-availability).

Alternatively, you can assign licenses as follows:

* [Assign licenses to one or more security groups](#to-assign-licenses-to-security-groups) as an Azure AD global admin
* [Assign licenses with PowerShell](assign-licenses-pshell.md) as a global Microsoft 365 admin

## To assign licenses to individual users

1. Sign in as a global admin to your tenant's [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal).
2. In the left navigation, select **Active users**, and then do one of the following to assign licenses to one user or to multiple users at the same time.

   **For one user**:
   1. In **Active users**, select the user from the list.
   2. Select the **ellipsis** (**...**) to view more actions, and then select **Manage product licenses**.
   3. In **Licenses and apps**, select the check box for **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights** (synonymous with Microsoft 365 Insights).
   4. Select **Save changes**, as shown in the following graphic.

5. Select **Assignment options** to open the right pane, confirm that both **Microsoft Workplace Analytics Insights** are set **On**, and then select **OK**.

   ![Keep both options set to On](./images/keep-options-on.png)

6. It can take a few minutes up to 24 hours for the license assignments to update to the server, which is based on your specific server settings.

> [!Note]
> If you are assigning licenses to a group that has more people than you have licenses for, the tool will assign users as listed in the group up to the number of available licenses, and then you'll see an error message about how many in the group have and do not have licenses.
