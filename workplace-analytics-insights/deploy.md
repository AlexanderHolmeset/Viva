# Deploy the app

[Teams Service Administrators](/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles#teams-roles-and-capabilities) can choose to deploy and pin the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams for all users or specific departments [through custom policies](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

Complete the steps in the following mini-playbooks to get the Microsoft Viva Insights app up and running for people in your organization.

1. Turn on the Viva Insights app for your organization:
[Release the Insights app within your organization](https://opdhsblobprod03.blob.core.windows.net/contents/c061aa4c5f284dcfb016c4d96b230182/a457392a39baa0ec7f8a83f3dd39563a?skoid=29100048-1fa1-4ada-b0e0-e2aa294fc66a&sktid=975f013f-7f24-47e8-a7d3-abc4752bf346&skt=2021-09-06T04%3A58%3A39Z&ske=2021-09-13T05%3A03%3A39Z&sks=b&skv=2020-08-04&sv=2020-08-04&se=2021-09-09T00%3A47%3A11Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=maJP%2BWrCXg%2FP5oXCnaWL%2BhQFCjLgqGAAZp1GQ43LCXM%3D).

   >[!Note]
   >Toâ€¯allow or block specific users in your organization from using Viva Insights, do the following:
   >
   >1. Make sure that Viva Insights is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](/microsoftteams/manage-apps) page.
   >
   >2. Create a custom-app permission policy and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission](/microsoftteams/manage-apps) policies in Teams.

2. Install the Viva Insights app for all employees in your organization: [Install the Viva Insights app](../workplaceanalytics/myanalytics/use/install-the-Insights-app.pdf).
3. Pin the Viva Insights app to the left navigation pane of Teams for all employees in your organization: [Pin the Viva Insights app](../workplaceanalytics/myanalytics/use/pin-the-Insights-app.pdf).
4. Now that the Viva Insights app is available for employees, they can follow these steps to locate and open it: [Find and open the Viva Insights app](../workplaceanalytics/myanalytics/use/find-and-open-the-Insights-app.pdf).
5. To give a person access to leader insights, assign the _Analyst (Limited)_ role in Workplace Analytics to that person. (See [Assign roles](../workplaceanalytics/setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md) for admin procedures; for general information about roles, see [Role descriptions and access levels](../workplaceanalytics/use/user-roles.md#role-descriptions-and-access-levels).)
