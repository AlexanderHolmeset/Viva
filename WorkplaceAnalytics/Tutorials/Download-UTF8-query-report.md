# Download a query report in UTF-8 format

Your query reports might not open properly if their data contains certain (multibyte) characters. This topic describes this problem and its workaround.

## Cannot properly open a .csv file

### Background

You have run a query to perform an analysis of workplace behavior. When the query finished, Workplace Analytics wrote the results to a .csv file, which it then placed in a compressed (zipped) folder. Now that you have your query results, you want to proceed with your analysis by opening the results in Microsoft Excel. 

At least one of the metrics that you used in this query includes meeting data from Outlook, and that data includes meeting subject lines. At least some of the meeting subject lines contains multibyte characters. This could be because your organization uses a multibyte language (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), or because the data contains characters such as an EM-DASH (—) or letters with diacritical marks (such as the ã in "São Paulo").

### Problem

These multibyte characters cause the .csv file to malfunction if you try to open it in Excel in the default way. 

### Solution

In the following procedure, you open a .csv file by importing it into Microsoft Excel as a UTF-8 file. After you have opened the file in this way, you can save it as an Excel file (with the .xlsx extension) or as a .csv file in UTF-8 format. Follow these steps:

The steps you take in this procedure differ in different versions of Excel. The following describe the steps for Excel 2016 and Excel 2010: 

#### Excel 2016

1. In Workplace Analytics, download the .zip file that contains the .csv report file. 
2. Extract the .csv file to a safe location on your computer; take note of this folder.
3. Open a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.
4. On the ribbon, open the Data tab.
5. In the Get & Transform Data area, select **From Text/CSV**.
6. In the Import Data dialog box, select the extracted .csv file and select **Import**.
7. In the dialog box that appears, change File Origin to **65001: Unicode (UTF-8)**. 
8. In the preview pane, examine the data. If it is still incorrect, contact [Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/) for further guidance. If the data is correct, go to the next step.
9. Select **Comma** as the delimiter.
10. Select **Load**.

#### Excel 2010

1. In Workplace Analytics, download the .zip file that contains the .csv report file.
2. Extract the .csv file to a safe location on your computer; take note of this folder.
3. Open a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.
4. On the ribbon, open the Data tab.
5. In the Get External Data area, select **From Text**.
6. In the Import Text File dialog box, locate the extracted .csv file and select **Import**.
7. Perform the following steps in the Text Import Wizard: 
   * *Step 1 of 3:* Under Original data type, select **Delimited** and then select **Next**.
   * *Step 2 of 3:* In the Delimiters area, select **Comma** and then select **Next**.
   * *Step 3 of 3:* Under Column data format, select **Text** and then select **Finish**.
8. The Import Data dialog box asks where you want to put the data. Choose any cell in the blank worksheet and then select **OK**.

The multibyte characters should now display correctly in Excel. You can save the file as an Excel file or an OpenDocument Spreadsheet file without losing the multibyte characters.
