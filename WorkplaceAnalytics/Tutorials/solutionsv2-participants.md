# Plans: The experience of plan participants

**Role** - participant in a plan, an information worker who is using MyAnalytics

While analysts and program managers create and manage programs in Workplace Analytics, the actual work of change is done by MyAnalytics users. These are the people for whom a need was identified and a plan created. They have the opportunity to change workplace habits for the better.
 
During a plan, participants receive or can view the following items:

<!-- THIS IS TURNED OFF FOR NOW (MAY 2019)
## Welcome email

As a program manager schedules a plan, they can choose to let participants receive an automatically generated [welcome email](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/welcome-msg-prog-partic.png) from Workplace Analytics. This one-time email explains the details of the plan: its sponsor, its duration, and its targets -- the habits that participants are expected to work on. 
-->

## MyAnalytics dashboard

The [MyAnalytics dashboard](../MyAnalytics/use/dashboard-2.md) is a constantly available resource for MyAnalytics users. In addition to its standard content, the dashboard also includes a new participant section during a plan. This section contains information such as recommended habits and the participant's progress against the plan goals, similar to the following:

## Digest

All MyAnalytics users receive a weekly [digest](../MyAnalytics/use/email-digest-2.md). In addition to its standard content, their digest for participants also includes a section that summarizes their progress in the plan, similar to the following:

## MyAnalytics inline suggestions

MyAnalytics inline suggestions in Outlook are brief, data- and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask whether you want to review them.

### Plan-only inline suggestions

While many inline suggestions are available to all MyAnalytics participants (see [broadly available inline suggestions](#broadly-available-inline-suggestions)), some apply only to participants of particular Teamwork plans, as described in [Collaboration plan](#collaboration-plan) and [Wellbeing plan](#wellbeing-plan):

#### Collaboration plan

Participants in the Collaboration plan might see the following inline suggestions:

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  	| Could this meeting be 45 minutes? Suggest shortening to save everyone one hour per month. **Reply to &lt;name&gt;** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Suggests that you ask the meeting organizer to shorten hour-long meetings to 45 minutes. |
|Meeting compose	| Some attendees have a lot of meetings this week. Is everyone required? **Mark whoâ€™s optional** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Suggests that you reconsider whether everyone is required in the meeting that you are organizing, in light of the high meeting load of your invitees. |

#### Wellbeing plan

Participants in the Wellbeing plan might see the following inline suggestion:

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Looks like this meeting is outside your typical working hours. Here are some alternate times that work for everyone. **See suggested times** &nbsp; | Suggests that you ask the organizer to move the meeting to a time during working hours that works for all attendees. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |

### Broadly available inline suggestions

A number of other inline suggestions are available to all MyAnalytics participants, whether or not they are enrolled in a Teamwork plan. They are described in the following tables:

#### Get more time to focus

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |Looks like you have a lot of meetings this/next week. Would you like to reserve some time for focused work? **See available times** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |Reminds you (the meeting attendee who has a heavy meeting load) to book time for focused work|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |This meeting conflicts with your scheduled focus time. Do you want to move your focus block? **See available times** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |Helps you to protect your focus time block, by suggesting that you move a booked focus session to another time when a meeting request conflicts with it.|

#### Stay up-to-date with important relationships

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ |-------|---------|
| Reading pane (email) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | You may have outstanding tasks for sender. Would you like to review now? **See my tasks**   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Reminds you that there might be outstanding task items for the sender. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  |

#### Reduce after-hours work and team impact

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Email compose &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | There are some open times during your working hours to catch up on email. **Book time**  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Suggests that you book time during the day to do email instead of catching up after hours.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  |

#### Build better collaboration habits

| :------ |-------|---------|
|Meeting compose &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Could this meeting be 45 minutes? Build in some buffer time and save attendees time. **Shorten meeting**  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Suggests that you shorten hour-long meetings to 45 minutes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
