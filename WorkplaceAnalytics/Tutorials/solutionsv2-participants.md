# Plans: The experience of plan participants

**Role** - participant in a plan, an information worker who is using MyAnalytics <!-- and is enrolled in a [MyAnalytics (Full) service plan](../myanalytics/overview/plans-environments.md#features-in-the-myanalytics-full-service-plan) REMOVING FOR NOW PER PRAMOD -->

While analysts and program managers can create and manage programs in Workplace Analytics, the actual work of change is done by MyAnalytics users. These are the people for whom a need was identified and a plan created. They have the opportunity to change workplace habits for the better. 

All plans are scheduled to start on a Sunday. As soon as the plan starts and through the duration of the plan, its participants will receive or can view the following items: 

<!-- THIS IS TURNED OFF FOR NOW (MAY 2019)
## Welcome email

As a program manager schedules a plan, they can choose to let participants receive an automatically generated [welcome email](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/welcome-msg-prog-partic.png) from Workplace Analytics. This one-time email explains the details of the plan: its sponsor, its duration, and its targets -- the habits that participants are expected to work on.  
-->

## MyAnalytics dashboard

The [MyAnalytics dashboard](../MyAnalytics/use/dashboard-2.md) is a constantly available resource for MyAnalytics users. In addition to its standard content, the dashboard also includes a new participant section during a plan.  

If user is part of a plan, there is no change to any of the existing tabs. A new tab called "Team Plans" is available in the dashboard to track plan progress. This added section contains information such as recommended habits and a report on the participant's progress against the plan goals:

## Digest

All MyAnalytics users receive a weekly [digest](../MyAnalytics/use/email-digest-2.md). Each week, the digest focuses on one of the work patterns: Focus, Wellbeing, Network, or Collaboration. The subject of the digest shifts from one pattern to the next, week after week. Note that this weekly focus is _not_ affected by a participant's enrollment in a plan. 

### Additional Teams Plan section

For plan participants, the digest email includes an additional section, the _Teams Plan_ section. This section summarizes their progress in the plan over the preceding week:

<!--  THIS SECTION CAN DESCRIBE THE EXCEPTION CAUSE BY "ADAPTIVE" AFTER WE GET THAT WORDING FROM PM. (PER PRAMOD, HELEN)
> [!Note] 
> This Team Plans section is unavailable in the following circumstance:
> * It is a week in which the digest email is about _Focus_ or _Network_.
> * You are using a particular email client application to view your digest emails.

## MyAnalytics inline suggestions

MyAnalytics inline suggestions in Outlook are brief, data- and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask whether you want to review them.

### Plan-only inline suggestions

Many inline suggestions are available to all MyAnalytics participants (see [broadly available inline suggestions](#broadly-available-inline-suggestions)), but some apply only to participants of a particular Teamwork plan, such as the [Collaboration plan](#collaboration-plan) or the [Wellbeing plan](#wellbeing-plan):


#### Collaboration plan

Participants in the Collaboration plan might see the following inline suggestion<!--s-->:

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  	| Could this meeting be 45 minutes?
