# Manager coaching

Employees who get little to no one-on-one time with their managers are more likely to be disengaged.

## Statistics

According to [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/): 

* “Bad management is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $398 billion annually."
* "The opportunity is huge for better-run organizations and a higher quality of life for workers.”

## Best practices

* **Lead by example**. People are more engaged if they work for a manager who is working at least as much as they are.
* **Evenly distribute work**. Highly utilized employees often work longer hours than their peers, which can lead to disengagement.
* **Maintain large internal networks across the company**. Employees with larger networks than their manager are more likely to view leadership unfavorably. (In order to qualify as a connection, one must interact with another person at least twice per month in an email or meeting with five or fewer participants.)
* **Schedule and keep one-on-ones with your employees**. Little or no one-on-one time with employees leads to disengagement.
