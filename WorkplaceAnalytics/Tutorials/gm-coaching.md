# Manager coaching

Employees who get little to no one-on-one time with their managers are more likely to be disengaged.

## Statistics

Those who get two times as many one-on-one meetings with their managers as compared to their peers are 67 percent less likely to be disengaged.

## Best practices

* After being scheduled on the calendar, you and your employees should prioritize your one-on-one meetings above most everything else. For details, see [Cancelling One-on-One Meetings Destroys Your Productivity](https://hbr.org/2015/03/cancelling-one-on-one-meetings-destroys-your-productivity).

* Ensure that both you and your employees are prepared with topics to discuss and that you allocate time for both of you to share your thoughts.

* One-on-ones can be a good opportunity to help your team members be more thoughtful about their careers and lives.

* The best one-on-one meetings with managers require that managerâ€™s full attention. Therefore, you should shut off your phone and other devices during these important meetings.
