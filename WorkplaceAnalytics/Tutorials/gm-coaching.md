# Manager coaching

Employees who get little to no one-on-one time with their manager are more likely to be disengaged.

## Statistic 

Those who get twice the number of one-on-ones with their manager relative to their peers are 67% less likely to be disengaged. (https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/) 
 
## Best practices

* After being scheduled on the calendar, managers and employees should prioritize manager 1:1s above most else. For details, see [Cancelling One-on-One Meetings Destroys Your Productivity](https://hbr.org/2015/03/cancelling-one-on-one-meetings-destroys-your-productivity).

* Ensure that both Managers and Employees are prepared to with topics to discuss and that time is allocated for both parties to share their thoughts.

* One-on-ones can be a good opportunity to help your team members be more thoughtful about their careers and lives.

* The best manager 1:1s require a managerâ€™s full attention, thus they should shut off their phones and laptops. See [How to Make Your One-on-Ones with Employees More Productive](https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-make-your-one-on-ones-with-employees-more-productive#comment-section) for details.
