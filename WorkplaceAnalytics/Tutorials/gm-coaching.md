# Best practices for manager coaching

Employees who get one-on-one time with their managers are more likely to be engaged than those who don't.

## Statistics

According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/):

* "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."
* "The opportunity is huge for better-run organizations and a higher quality of life for workers.”
* “Bad management is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $398 billion annually."

## Best practices

* Lead by example. People are more engaged if they work for a manager who is working at least as much as they are.
* Evenly distribute work. Highly utilized employees often work longer hours than their peers, which can lead to disengagement.
* Maintain large internal networks across the company. Employees with larger networks than their manager are more likely to view leadership unfavorably. (In order to qualify as a connection, one must interact with another person at least twice per month in an email or meeting with five or fewer participants.)
* Schedule and keep one-on-ones with your employees. Consistent one-on-one manager time with employees leads to more positive employee engagement.
