# Meeting exclusion rules in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics uses email and calendar activities that are stored in a person's Office 365 account to reveal internal and external collaboration trends. However, a person's calendar and email can contain a diverse set of activities (such as personal meetings, work-related social activities, all-day training meetings, and so forth) that are not relevant to work-related collaboration, and, if included in the metrics, would skew query results.

>[!Note] 
> There is a problem with meetings that have more than 250 participants. For more information, see [Meeting exclusion rules: Large-meeting limitation](meeting-exclusion-250.md).

Meeting exclusion rules are used in Workplace Analytics to help ensure that query results accurately represent relevant meeting norms within the organization. <!-- Organizations can also use these rules to promote privacy by excluding from analysis meetings that are of a sensitive nature.  -->

Workplace Analytics provides a default meeting exclusion rule that excludes a set of meetings that would commonly fall outside of relevant collaboration for analysis. Analysts can also use the meeting exclusion feature to create custom meeting exclusion rules.
