# Best practices for wellbeing

Employee burnout accounts for 20 to 50 percent of their company’s annual employee turnover costs. More than 40 percent of creative ideas come when you are taking breaks or allowing your mind to wander. For details, see [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can’t](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/).

## Statistics

A recent study of 1,400 information workers commissioned by Microsoft found that 40 percent of people work outside of regular hours in a way that interferes with their family time.

## Best practices

* Communicate that the organization’s success is based on a marathon, not a sprint. See [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can’t](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/) for details.

* Require employees to utilize at least part of their paid time off. Ensure your employees have no tacit barriers to taking time off. See [Managing the High-Intensity Workplace](https://hbr.org/2016/06/managing-the-high-intensity-workplace) for more information.

* Evenly spread work within your team, employees who have more work as compared to their coworkers leads to burnout. See [What Great Managers Do Daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/) for more about avoiding burnout.
