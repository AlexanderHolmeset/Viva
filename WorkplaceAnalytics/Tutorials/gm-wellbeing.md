# Best practices for wellbeing

 More than 40 percent of creative ideas come when you are taking breaks or allowing your mind to wander. Employee burnout accounts for 20 to 50 percent of their company’s annual employee turnover costs. See [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can’t](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/) to learn more.

## Statistics

Based on research presented in the article about [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/), employees need to unplug:

* "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."
* “Eighty-seven percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year.”
* "According to the recent study of 1,400 workers, nearly half of respondents said that thinking about work outside of work hours regularly has a negative impact on their work-life balance."

## Best practices

* Remind employees that the organization’s success is based on a marathon, not a sprint.  
* Encourage team to take turns taking time off. This reinforces trust, collaboration, efficiency which can lead to better work satisfaction.
* Practice setting and keeping boundaries. Boundaries can result in better overall team outcomes.
