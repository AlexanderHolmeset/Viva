# Best practices for wellbeing

Employee burnout accounts for 20 to 50 percent of their company’s annual employee turnover costs. More than 40 percent of creative ideas come when you are taking breaks or allowing your mind to wander. See [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can’t](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/) to read more.

## Statistics

“Eighty-seven percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year,” according to [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/).

## Best practices

* Remind employees that the organization’s success is based on a marathon, not a sprint.  
* Encourage team to take turns taking time off. This reinforces trust, collaboration, efficiency which can lead to better work satisfaction.
* Practice setting and keeping boundaries. Boundaries can result in better overall team outcomes.
