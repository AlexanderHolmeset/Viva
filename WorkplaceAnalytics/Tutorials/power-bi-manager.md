# Manager effectiveness

The Manager effectiveness dashboard for Power BI uses Workplace Analytics data to view standard behaviors and leadership exposure among managers in your organization. Leaders can use this analysis to measure behaviors and trends of people managers across the organization. You'll also get insights about key behaviors by organization and best practices recommended by industry experts to either maintain or improve leadership work patterns.

This dashboard provides insights into the following areas about your organization.

* **Manager metrics** - Shows the metrics and trends about manager behaviors in key areas, such as average collaboration, meeting, email, and focus hours.
* **Leadership exposure** – Shows how leaders interact with employees in your organization, including manager coaching hours, manager generated workload meetings and email, meeting hours with managers, and skip-level meetings.

The dashboard includes the following reports that answer the related business questions, along with a **Why it matters** interpretation.

* **Coach - Do managers have enough time for their employees?** - Shows the weekly average number of hours that managers spend collaborating with people in the organization grouped by organizationa and type of communication, including meetings, emails, chats, and calls. It also shows the average percentage of collaboration time that managers spent with direct reports as compared to others in the organization.
* **Coach - Are employees receiving sufficient coaching time with their manager?** – Shows the monthly average number of minutes that employees spent in 1:1 meetings with their direct managers. It also shows the percentage of employees who spent different ranges of time in the last four weeks in 1:1s with their manager and the average frequency of 1:1 time for employees grouped by organization in a week, month, or quarter.
* **Empower - Are managers balancing oversight with employee autonomy?** - Shows the percentage of employees whose managers co-attend their meetings and the weekly average number of hours that managers co-attended meetings with their direct reports.
* **Empower - How are manager habits impacting employee empowerment, workflows, and trust?** - Compares average percentages of collaboration load that's generated by managers as compared to individual contributors grouped by organization. It also compares scheduled and unscheduled collaboration time that managers generate, including meetings, email, Teams calls and chats.
* **Connect - Do managers have a large, diverse, and influential network to enable and support their teams?** - Shows average connectivity metrics for managers, including distinct internal connections across different organizations and what percentage of managers are in the top 20 percent of influencers. It also shows details about the size and breadth of contacts and influencing potential for managers, which are grouped by organization.
* **Connect - Do well-connected and influential managers have well-connected teams?** - Shows the internal network size of managers as compared to individual contributors grouped by organization. It also shows the internal network size distribution of managers as compared to the full organizational population grouped by organization.
* **Model - Are managers modeling good work-life balance?** -Shows the weekly average of after-hours work for managers as compared to individual contributors in the organization. It also shows the difference in average workweek span collaboration hours for managers and for individual contributors, which is grouped by organization.
* **Track changes - How are manager behaviors evolving?** - Shows metrics for the key indicator trends for managers, including metrics about coaching and empowerment, network connections, and after-hours work habits.
* **Areas of improvement - How can manager effectiveness be improved?** - Lists some opportunity areas with related best practices and recommendations and links to related articles about ways to help your managers improve in each area.

To populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must set up and successfully run the predefined **Manager effectiveness** query in Workplace Analytics. After you successfully run it, you'll see the Power BI template as an available download option for the query. This template is required to create the dashboard in Power BI. After you download the Power BI template, you can then connect the query data from Workplace Analytics to the dashboard in Power BI.

When the dashboard is populated with your data, you can use it to visualize, explore, and report about your manager's workplace patterns and trends.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the query and populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must:

* Be assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics.
