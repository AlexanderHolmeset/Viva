# Best practices for cross-group collaboration

Connecting employees across units creates agile innovation by helping the company leverage benefits of scale, cross-pollinate ideas, and integrate different perspectives.

## Why it matters

 The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explains how important cross-group collaboration is for getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

## Best practices

* Improve internal connectivity. Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. Employees who maintain large, stable, and diversified internal networks are often better positioned to leverage their connections for quickly responding to customer needs and driving customer satisfaction.
* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) that focus on customer needs.
* Use [MyAnalytics to manage important people](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to mark key internal contacts as important to never miss emails from them and to respond more efficiently.
* Breakdown silos and expand networks with cross-functional goals to help improve communications with isolated teams by assigning interdepartmental liaisons to communicate across teams.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.  
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.  
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.  
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

### Change catalyst: Provide managers with go-to contacts list

Survey the group to collect and create a list of contacts that would be a good starting place for employees to contact when trying to establish a new connection. This can empower managers with the right contacts in order to solve their employees' problems. Ways to do this:

* Send out a company wide email where people can volunteer to be a connector within their team.
* Combine all of these connectors into a list and share that list with managers.
* Explain to all employees that managers now have a list of go-to contacts.
