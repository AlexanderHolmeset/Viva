# Best practices for avoiding email overload

Employees need time to disconnect from work. Studies show that we all need mental recovery time to reduce stress, increase creativity, and avoid burnout.

## Statistics

Based on research presented in the article about [Protecting company culture means having rules for email](https://insights.office.com/productivity/protecting-company-culture-from-after-hours-work/):

* “Dealing with after-hours emails produces anxiety that is damaging not only to the worker, but to their family."
* "It’s not just the amount of time taken up by reading and answering emails after work that’s stressing out employees (and their partners)."
* "In fact, what’s creating more anxiety is just the expectation that an employee will be available for work outside the office.”

## Best practices

* Designate a communication channel that is intended for urgent messages at any time.  
* Enable employees to disconnect from email after work. If something urgent comes up, they can be reached by the alternative channels.
* Set clear expectations and urge management to set the right example for the rest of the organization.
