# Best practices for email overload

When there is an expectation to be available on email around the clock, employees can’t disconnect from work.  Over time, this can prevent mental recovery time, reduce creativity, and lead to burnout.

## Statistics

According to [Protecting company culture means having rules for email](https://insights.office.com/productivity/protecting-company-culture-from-after-hours-work/): “Dealing with after-hours emails produces anxiety that is damaging not only to the worker, but to their family. It’s not just the amount of time taken up by reading and answering emails after work that’s stressing out employees (and their partners). In fact, what’s creating more anxiety is just the expectation that an employee will be available for work outside the office.”

## Best practices

* Designate a communication channel that is intended for urgent messages at any time.  
* Enable employees to disconnect from email after work.  If something urgent comes up, they can be reached by your alternative channels.
* Set clear expectations and urge management to set the right example for the rest of the organization.
