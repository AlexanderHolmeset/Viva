# Best practices for efficient communication

Different communication tools are suited for different means. While emails are great for recaps, updates, and other informational exchanges, it can slow down or muddle an important message. Choosing the right medium speeds information access and agility.

## Statistics

Based on the information presented in the article about [What email, IM, and the phone are each good for](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/what-email-im-and-the-phone-are-each-good-for/), you might be hampering productivity with too many emails:

* "We default to email to connect with people — to the tune of 122 business emails, on average, per person per day" 
* “Your colleagues have plenty on their own to-do lists."
* "In order to get the response you need, when you need it, you must make it as easy as possible for the recipient to get back to you — and this is where choosing the right medium makes a difference.”

## Best practices

* Consider the nature of the conversation based on the subject and type of response needed and identify the appropriate medium for communication.
* Encourage using instant messages for urgent questions to get what you need faster.
* When dealing with a sensitive topic, a quick chat on the phone or in person is more ideal than volleying emails back and forth.
* Schedule a more structured meeting or conference call when dealing with multiple people.
* Keep emails short and be sure the subject line is searchable.
