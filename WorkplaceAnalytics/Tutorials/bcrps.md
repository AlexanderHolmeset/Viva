# Business continuity report

Organizations around the world are responding to sudden changes in the way they work. Microsoft wants to help you understand the business impact and what your organization can do to help navigate the shift to remote work.

The Business continuity report is a Workplace Intelligence report thatâ€™s available to Microsoft 365 customers within the Microsoft Productivity Score report. It analyzes [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph) data to provide high-level insights about how collaboration for an organization has changed between the baseline timeframe of January to February 2020 as compared to a current snapshot of March to the present.

This report helps business leaders understand if employees are:

* Adapting to the shift to remote work.
* Able to maintain work-life balance.
* Able to effectively meet and share ideas and information remotely.
* Maintaining their community connections.

The following are some of the top-level business questions this report helps you analyze.

|Business question |Analysis |Metrics used |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
|How is employee collaboration changing? |As remote work becomes the new normal, using online communication tools for collaboration and teamwork will help people in your organization succeed. |**Collaboration hours** - Total time employees spent in meetings, chats, and on email activity shown on average weekly. The hours include both internal and external hours. <br> <br>**Collaboration time for meeting activity** - The sum of the durations of meetings an employee has on their calendar (not counting meeting time that overlaps). <br> <br>**Collaboration time for email activity** - Approximated as 5 minutes for a composed email, and 2.5 minutes for a read email. <br> <br>**Collaboration time for instant message activity** - Approximated by 30 seconds for each instant message (sent and received). |
|Is the wellbeing of employees being protected? |Without a physical separation between office and home, personal demands and meetings during the work day increase. This means that more work is occurring outside of standard business hours, leading to longer work days, which can lead to employee burnout and attrition. |**Collaboration hours by time of day** - After-hours work is the number of hours employees spend in meetings, chats, and on email outside of working hours. Working hours are based on the employees' Outlook calendar settings.|
|Are remote meetings effective? |As collaboration shifts from in-person to remote, increased meeting load can overwhelm employees and slow down decision making. Research shows that shorter meetings with fewer attendees promotes focus and faster decisions. |**Meeting length and attendee count** - Long meetings are those scheduled for more than an hour. Large meetings are those that involve more than 8 people.|
|Are employees able to create and share effectively while working remotely? |As communication and ideation shifts from in-person to online, people need to embrace online collaboration tools and knowledge-sharing solutions to exchange ideas and insights, get feedback, and stay informed. |**Number of readers, creators, and collaborators over time** - Content collaboration is defined as one person creating and sharing an Office file, and then at least one other person editing it. |
|Do employees feel a sense of belonging and inclusion at work? |Remote work can leave people feeling isolated. A feeling of belonging to a community is important for engagement and morale as people navigate this change from in-person to remote work. |**Yammer community interactions** - Team cohesion is measured by Yammer community interactions, including posts, likes, and reads. |
