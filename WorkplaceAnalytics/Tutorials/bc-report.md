# Business continuity report

The Business continuity report analyzes Microsoft Graph data to provide high-level insights about how your organizationâ€™s collaboration norms have changed due to the recent global shift in standard business practices. 

This 60-day snapshot helps business leaders answer the following questions:

* How is "business as usual" changing?  
* How are employees adapting to the shift?  
* Are we maintaining external relationships?

## About the report 

The Business continuity report directionally highlights where shifts in ways of working are having the largest impact, and provides a measurable starting point for identifying where leaders can use tools and processes to support employees in a new way of working.

* **How is 'business as usual' changing?** - Shows the trend in collaboration hours by channel. 
* **How are employees adapting to the shift?** - Enables you to assess whether some employees are disproportionately affected by measuring their changes in after hours work.
* **Are we maintaining external relationships?** - Quantifies changes in communication with customers, partners and other people outside the organization.
