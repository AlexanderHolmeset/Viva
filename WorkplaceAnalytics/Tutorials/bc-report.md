# Business continuity Report

The Business continuity report analyzes Microsoft Graph data to provide high-level insights about how your organizationâ€™s collaboration norms have changed due to the recent global shift in standard business practices. 

This 60-day snapshot helps business leaders answer the following questions:

* How is "business as usual" changing?  
* How are employees adapting to the shift?  
* Are we maintaining external relationships?
