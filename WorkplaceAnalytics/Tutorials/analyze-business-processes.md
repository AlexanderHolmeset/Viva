# Introduction

When you and your co-workers perform an organized series of steps to reach a goal, you've participated in a business process. For example, your organization's hiring process might consist of obtaining leads, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making an offer, and sending new hires to HR to complete onboarding paperwork. Subsequent business processes might have training and coaching goals.

You can improve your business processes by analyzing them; for example, by measuring their cost &ndash; in time and money. You conduct such an analysis by running a Workplace Analytics query in which you designate the business process as a filter for the query. To improve the accuracy of the results that this query generates, you should first define a data set that defines the data being queried.

Here, therefore, is the sequence of procedures that you follow to analyze a business process: 

1. [Define a data set](#define-a-data-set)

2. [Define a business process](#define-a-business-process)

3. [Analyze a business process](#analyze-a-business-process)

The following sections describe these processes. 

## Define a data set
Before you define business processes, you need to define the data set that’s applicable to that business process. For example, your company might have a global footprint, but you want to analyze only the processes of one subsidiary. Limit the data set for your query by filtering out organizational data that does not apply. 
  

## Define a business process
Before you can run a query to analyze them, you need to define business processes within your organization so that you can use them in filters in queries. 

### Business process statuses
The following are the list of statuses for any Business process (including OOTB topics): 
 
* Draft &ndash; This indicates that a Business process is being created or edited but not yet submitted to the system. This is an intermittent state until the analyst feels that the Business process is ready to be submitted for processing by the system 
 
* In progress &ndash; This indicates that a Business process has just been created and is being processed by the system 
 
* Ready &ndash; This indicates that a Business process has been successfully published and is readily accessible across WpA (scopes permitting of course) 

* Archived &ndash; This indicates that a Business process has been archived 

* Error: This is a generic catch-all failed state that indicates that processing of the Business process itself has failed, when it is switching from “In progress” to the “Ready” state
