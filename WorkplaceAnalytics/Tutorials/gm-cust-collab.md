# Best practices for customer collaboration

Spending time collaborating with customers helps your organization better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

## Why it matters

The following are based on research presented in the [The loyalty economy: Are you undervaluing your customers?](https://insights.office.com/business-performance/the-loyalty-economy-are-you-undervaluing-customers/), [Optimizing sales and connecting with customers in the age of big data and machine learning](https://insights.office.com/sales-excellence/optimizing-sales-workplace-analytics/), and [What makes great salespeople](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/what-makes-great-salespeople/) articles:

* "...companies at the top of their industries in net promoter scores or satisfaction rankings for three or more years—grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. Yet companies and investors continue to prioritize quarterly earnings over customer relationships..."
* “More time spent with customers; larger internal networks; and more time spent with managers and senior leadership. These three behaviors persisted regardless of region, territory, or sales role, suggesting that they are foundational ingredients for success.”

## Best practices

* Encourage employees to build deeper relationships with customers. Developing customer empathy enables employees to identify the emotional needs of their customers and understand the reasons why and respond in a way that creates a long-lasting  relationship with customers.
* Identify opportunities to free up employees’ time spent on administrative tasks or internal meetings, so they have more time to spend with customers.
* Facilitate direct interaction with customers, even in “back office” functions. Every employee impacts the customer experience in some way and interacting with customers enables a better understanding of customer needs and their successes and challenges.
* Democratize customer insights with customer facing teams that create a culture where customers can help drive decisions.
* Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. Employees who maintain large, stable, and diversified internal networks are often better positioned to leverage their connections for quickly responding to customer needs and driving customer satisfaction.
