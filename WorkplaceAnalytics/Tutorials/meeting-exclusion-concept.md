# Meeting exclusion rules: Tools and concepts

This article describes screen elements and concepts that will help you create and use meeting exclusion rules in Workplace Analytics. For step-by-step walkthroughs, see [Meeting exclusion rules: Walkthroughs](meeting-exclusion-rules.md). 

At each step in the exclusion-creation flow, you'll see a page, such as the following. 

  ![Interactive tools](../images/wpa/tutorials/08-interactive-tools.png)
 
In the following sections, you'll learn more about the pages you use in the exclusion-creation steps.

## Progress summaries  

### Progress bar

The progress bar at the top of the page tracks where you are in the flow: 

![Progress bar](../images/wpa/tutorials/12-progress-bar.png)

### Summary of meetings that remain

This section tracks how many meetings and meeting hours remain in your analysis as you exclude meetings. This view updates every time you advance to the next step in the flow. 

These numbers help you understand the effects of the exclusions that are already in place and the effect of the exclusion created in the current step. This helps you confirm whether to remove these meetings and decide which meetings, if any, that you want to keep in your analysis. 

Before you apply any filters, 100% of meeting hours are still available for analysis, as are 100% of the meetings that have been held in the time since Workplace Analytics began to use data from Office 365.

  ![Meeting hours summary (before)](../images/wpa/tutorials/09-summary-meetings-hours.png)

As the [Create a meeting exclusion rule](meeting-exclusion-rules.md) walkthrough describes, as you complete each step and move on to the next one, you'll see the number of meetings and meeting hours decrease as the exclusion is applied to your data.

## Interactive summary of the current exclusion step

The middle section of the page shows you a summary of the current exclusion step:

  ![Middle of page](../images/wpa/tutorials/11-mid-page.png)

This section has the following informative areas: 

 * On the left, you see the types of meetings this step addresses. The exclusion description helps you understand the purpose of the current step.
 * In the center, you see details about the meetings that this exclusion would remove from analysis. This section helps you keep track of the customizations you have made to the current exclusion.
 * On the right, you see the effects of the current exclusion step if you apply it, namely: What percentage of meeting hours and of meetings would it exclude? In other words, what impact would this step have on the remaining meeting data?
  
   >[!Tip] 
   >Pay particular attention to the number shown for _Excluded meeting hours_. This metric is usually more important than the percentage of meetings because time spent in meetings is a more important indicator when analyzing meeting behavior than the sheer number of meetings, which can vary greatly in length. 

## Customization working area

Below the **Summary of meetings that remain**, you can customize four of the five exclusion types: appointments, large meetings, long meetings, and meetings by topic. (The _cancelled meetings_ exclusion type cannot be customized, but you can choose not to use the exclusion in your rule.)

You make the following types of customizations:

 * You can change the default filter value for any step that has a numerical filter. For more information, see [Walkthrough: add a meeting exclusion rule](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#walkthrough----add-a-meeting-exclusion-rule).
 * You can choose which keywords and topics that you would like to exclude from analysis. For more information, see [Walkthrough: add a meeting exclusion rule](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#walkthrough----add-a-meeting-exclusion-rule). 
 * You can create [exceptions to an exclusion](#make-an-exception-to-an-exclusion).
 * For these customizations, you can use keywords and topics in the following [list of languages](#supported-languages).

### Make an exception to an exclusion

Sometimes, the default exclusion filters out meetings that you may want to keep in your analysis. You may want to make exceptions to an exclusion without removing the entire exclusion itself. The tools described in this section will help you identify which meetings you may want to keep in your analysis based on the keywords associated with these meeting subject lines.

For steps 2-4 in the meeting exclusion creation flow, appointments, large meetings, and long meetings, you can use the  [Word cloud](#word-cloud), a [Phrase table](#phrase-table), and search capability ([Keyword search](#keyword-search)) to customize your exclusions in this manner.

### Word cloud

Below the heading **Identify exceptions** is a word cloud that displays keywords from meeting subject lines. It includes only keywords for meetings that meet the filter criteria that are being applied on the current step. In a word cloud, the larger the size of text of a keyword, the more meeting hours the keyword represents. You can use keywords and topics in the following [supported languages](#supported-languages).

The filter context of the word cloud always reflects the filter context for the step that you are on. For example, in the _Exclude small meetings_ step, the keywords were found in the meeting invitations where the number of attendees is less than or equal to one. 

While you define the exclusion, if you adjust that filter context, the word cloud is re-filtered accordingly. 

To remove a keyword from this exclusion, select the keyword in the word cloud and then select **Make an exception**. Before you remove it, you might want to learn more about it and its impact on the data. To learn more, do one of the following: 

 * Hover over the keyword to see the meeting hours and meeting count.
 * Select the keyword. This selects the keyword and displays details about its impact on meeting hours in the Phrase table. The [Phrase table](#phrase-table) is described later in this step.

### Keyword search

You might know of a specific word that you want to retain in your analysis (that is, remove from the exclusion). If you cannot find that word in the word cloud, search for it in the field marked **Search for a keyword**. This lets you search for phrases that contain one, two, or three words. If the keyword is found, Workplace Analytics displays data in the Phrase table about removing it from the exclusion. To remove it from the exclusion, select **Make an exception**. 

#### Remove an exception

After you make an exception of a word, it appears above the word cloud. If you change your mind, you can remove the word from the exception list. To do this, select the **X** next to the word. This returns it to the group of keywords whose meetings will be excluded. 
 
  ![Exclude meetings where](../images/wpa/tutorials/04-exclude-meetings-where.png)
 
You can also remove all of your exceptions to this exclusion at once. To do this, select **Reset**. 

### Phrase table

Workplace Analytics shows a table named **Phrases that contain the selected keyword**. This table can help you understand the context of meetings that are associated with this subject-line phrase or keyword. 

### Example 1: Business

The words "business" or "marketing" in the word cloud represent meetings that you might want to include in your analysis. To help you decide, you can see the effects of removing this keyword (and its meetings) from the exclusion. For example, if you select **business**, Workplace Analytics shows what percentage of meetings have this word in their subject line and the total number of hours for those meetings:

  ![Percentages](../images/wpa/tutorials/02-word-cloud-business.png)

In the following illustration, the word "business" has been excepted from the exclusion, which means that meetings with "business" in their invitations' subject lines will be _retained_ in your analysis: 

  ![Selected keyword](../images/wpa/tutorials/03-selected-keyword.png)
 
### Example 2: Soccer

The word cloud contains "soccer," which you select. Now, if the Phrase table shows phrases such as "soccer practice" or "soccer league," this might indicate that meetings with "soccer" in the subject line were not work-related and therefore are appropriate to exclude from analysis. 

However, if you work for an athletic-equipment supplier and this table displays phrases such as "soccer product review," these meetings are probably work related and therefore should be included for analysis. To retain this keyword and its associated meetings, you make it an exception to the exclusion rule. To do this, select **Make an exception** adjacent to the word cloud. 
 
If you notice other words in the cloud that you might want to retain in your analysis, select them, review the **Phrases that contain the selected keyword** table, and, when appropriate, select **Make an exception**. 

## Default meeting-exclusion rule

Workplace Analytics supplies one meeting exclusion rule by default, the Default meeting exclusion rule. This rule filters out meetings that are longer than 8 hours or whose number of attendees is one or fewer or 50 or more. 

This default rule is a good start, but if you were to use only it, you would miss the opportunity to verify that this rule doesn't exclude important meetings you wanted to keep, as well as the opportunity to exclude additional meetings based on meeting-subject keywords. 

To create a custom rule for your organization, follow the steps in [Create a meeting exclusion rule](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#create-a-meeting-exclusion-rule).

## Rule actions

In the list of rules, the area to the right of the State column provides actions that you can take with rules. Each rule has a primary action that you can take by clicking the icon. For published rules, select the eye icon to view the rule. For draft rules, select the pencil icon to edit the rule:

![State column](../images/wpa/tutorials/state-column.png)
 
To see other actions that are available for the rule, hover your cursor over the ellipsis at the end of the row:

![Secondary rule actions](../images/wpa/tutorials/active-actions.png)
 
### Published rules

For published rules, the actions are:

 * **Duplicate** creates an exact copy of the rule.
 * **Set preferred** sets this rule as the preferred rule. Note that there can be only one preferred rule. The preferred rule appears on the Explore dashboards and on the Solutions pages. It also appears at the top of the list of rules on the Analysis settings page. (The **Set preferred** action is unavailable for the rule that is currently set as preferred.) 
 * **Archive** archives the rule.  
 * **Favorite** sets the rule as a favorite. This is a sorting action. Rules that are favorites are displayed together near the top of any list of rules. (For rules that have been set as favorites, the "Unfavorite" option is available; it reverses the favorite status of the rule.)

### Draft rules

For draft rules, the available actions are **Duplicate** and **Delete**:

![Duplicate](../images/wpa/tutorials/mx-draft-dupe-and-delete.png) 

### Archived rules

For archived rules, the available actions are **Delete** and **Restore**. **Restore** returns the rule to the list of published rules:

## Application of meeting exclusion rules

Workplace Analytics provides a default meeting exclusion rule. You and other analysts can create new rules. Are all these rules available to all analysts? Can you combine your rules with theirs, or with the default rule? This section answers those questions and others. 

Q1. **Scope of meeting exclusion rules:** You create meeting exclusion rules on the Meeting exclusions page, which is reached through the Settings page of Workplace Analytics. After you create rules, where can you apply them in Workplace Analytics?

A1.  Exclusion rules apply in two areas where analysts work most: 

 * **Explore page dashboards:** Exclusion rules work for analysts as they inspect data in the Explore dashboards. For more information, see [Select which rule to use](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#select-which-rule-to-use).
 * **Queries.** Analysts can also apply exclusion rules when creating, refining, and running queries in Workplace Analytics. For more information, see [Use rules with queries](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#use-rules-with-queries).

Q2. **Edit existing rules?** Can you change/edit the default meeting-exclusion rule, or rules that you or other analysts have created? 

A2.  You can edit a rule only if it has been saved as a draft. You cannot change or edit published rules.

Q3. **Share rules?** Can rules be viewed and shared by others? If you create a rule, does it or can it be applied to the data and queries that are used by other analysts? 

A3.  Yes. Anyone in your organization can use the rules that anyone else in the organization has created.

Q4. **Combine rules?** Can you combine rules? For example, can you use the default meeting-exclusion rule and then layer a new rule on top of it, so that both are in effect? Can you combine a rule of your own with a rule that another analyst has defined?

A4.  No. You can have only one rule in effect at a time. For more information, see [Select which rule to use](meeting-exclusion-rules.md#select-which-rule-to-use).
