# Best practices for manager connectedness

Managers can help share ideas and expertise across the company. This cross-unit collaboration helps to leverage scattered resources, drive continual innovation, and keep ahead of the competition.

Managers who have diverse ties across an organization are typically considered more effective and help their employees build strong networks.

## Why it matters

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explains how important cross-group collaboration is in getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural brokers:

* "Cultural brokers promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."
* “The value of horizontal collaboration is widely recognized."
* "Employees who can reach outside their silos to find colleagues with complementary expertise learn more, sell more, and gain skills faster.”

## Best practices

* Create cross-team communities for people with similar interests to share ideas, knowledge, and resources. This can also be done by using [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
* Enable and use the [Insights Outlook add-in](/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md) and [MyAnalytics Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add colleagues to your **Important people** list, receive suggestions to meet, reminders to respond to email, and complete tasks for these contacts. And urge your team to do the same.
* Host informal gatherings, such as virtual opportunities for your team to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities, such as online trivia games.
* Strengthen connections with a [Teams channel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for group communications and chats.
* Encourage and train workers to ask the right questions. Minimize preconceptions by asking open-ended questions.  
* Get people to see things through others’ eyes by organizing carefully structured, face-to-face, cross-silo dialogues.
* Urge employees to explore distant networks. Employees need to be pushed to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.
* Identify employees with strong interpersonal skills and a growth mindset to build relationships and collaborate across different functions and geographies.
* Identify the groups that should be involved, such as Support, Services, and Engineering.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.
* Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. A culture of fear exists when employees do not feel safe to come forward with ideas, and those on the fringe may be less conﬁdent about contributing.
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

## Change catalysts

#### Open your network to your team

If you have a large network, you can help broaden your team's networks as well. Start by reviewing your key contacts and identifying connections that match the interests and skills of your team members. The following can help you get started:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../MyAnalytics/Use/network.md), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and your contacts list to review your network.
* Categorize topics of expertise for those in your network.
* Review the career goals and skills of those on your team.
* Create a contact list and store it in a central location to access when onboarding new team members.
* Make introductions between relevant contacts and your team members.

#### Create goals across teams or departments

Managers can coordinate and assign liaison roles to communicate across teams and with other departments to help avoid isolation and ensure information flow. For example, the following are a few goals for improving customer satisfaction:

* Identify a cross-team goal of improving customer satisfaction.
* Identify the groups that should be involved, such as Support, Services, and Engineering.
* Align on an initial project and a platform, such as a Teams channel, to quickly find and respond to customer incidents.
* Create a platform to share ideas, such as a Teams channel and a monthly check-in meeting.

#### Build strong connections with Teams

Use [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) to interact with others based on topics of interest or across different teams. Try out the built-in Microsoft tips and resources to accelerate adoption.
