# Best practices for manager connectedness

Managers can help share ideas and expertise across the company. This cross-unit collaboration helps to leverage scattered resources, drive continual innovation, and keep ahead of the competition.

## Statistics

Research shows that employees who report to a manager with a relatively large internal network (in the top quarter of all managers) have engagement scores up to 5 percent higher as compared to their peer managers. Additionally, these employees had networks up to 85 percent larger than those of their colleagues reporting to managers with smaller networks. See [What Great Managers Do Daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/) for details.

## Best practices

* Encourage and train workers to ask the right questions.

* Get people to see things through othersâ€™ eyes by organizing cross-silo dialog.

* Leaders should set up cross-silo discussions that help employees see the world through the eyes of customers or colleagues in other parts of the company.

* Urge employees to explore distant networks. Employees need to be pushed to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.
