# Best practices for manager connectedness

Managers can help share ideas and expertise across the company. This cross-unit collaboration helps to leverage scattered resources, drive continual innovation, and keep ahead of the competition.

## Why it matters

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural brokers:

* "Cultural brokers promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."
* “The value of horizontal collaboration is widely recognized."
* "Employees who can reach outside their silos to find colleagues with complementary expertise learn more, sell more, and gain skills faster.”

## Best practices

* Ask employees to use [MyAnalytics network features](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add people to their "important people" list, which enables suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from them.
* Host informal gatherings, such as virtual opportunities for your team to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities, such as online trivia games.
* Strengthen connections with a [Teams channel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for group communications and chats.
* Encourage and train workers to ask the right questions. Minimize preconceptions by asking open-ended questions.  
* Get people to see things through others’ eyes by organizing carefully structured, face-to-face, cross-silo dialogues.
* Urge employees to explore distant networks. Employees need to be pushed to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.
* Identify employees with strong interpersonal skills and a growth mindset to build relationships and collaborate across different functions and geographies.

## Change catalyst: Open your network to your teams

If you have a large network, you can help broaden your team's networks as well. Start by reviewing your key contacts and identifying connections that match the interests and skills of your team members. The following can help you get started:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../MyAnalytics/Use/network.md), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and your contacts list to review your network.
* Categorize topics of expertise for those in your network.
* Review the career goals and skills of those on your team.
* Create a contact list and store it in a central location to access when onboarding new team members.
* Make introductions between relevant contacts and your team members.
