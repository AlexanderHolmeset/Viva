# Best practices for manager connectedness

Managers can help share ideas and expertise across the company. This cross-unit collaboration helps to leverage scattered resources, drive continual innovation, and keep ahead of the competition.

## Statistics

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural brokers:

* "Cultural brokers promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."
* “The value of horizontal collaboration is widely recognized."
* "Employees who can reach outside their silos to find colleagues with complementary expertise learn more, sell more, and gain skills faster.”

## Best practices

* Encourage and train workers to ask the right questions. Minimize preconceptions by asking open-ended questions.  
* Get people to see things through others’ eyes by organizing carefully structured, face-to-face, cross-silo dialogues.
* Urge employees to explore distant networks. Employees need to be pushed to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.
* Identify employees with strong interpersonal skills and a growth mindset to build relationships and collaborate across different functions and geographies.
