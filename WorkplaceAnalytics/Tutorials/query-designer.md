# Query designer

The Query designer in Workplace Analytics has a number of different options that help you answer specific business questions and the flexibility to look at the data from multiple perspectives.

* Select as many or as few organizational metrics as you need, for a specific population or time range.
* Customize metrics with a broad range of filters and other options.
* Combine queries to gain even more in-depth insights.

The designer includes the following.

* **Templates** - Use predefined queries and companion Power BI templates and reports to upload and view your query results in Microsoft Power BI. These help you focus on specific business outcomes, such as for transforming your meeting culture, enhancing organizational resiliency, developing effective managers, boosting employee engagement, and more.
* **Queries** - As shown in the following graphic, use the base query options to customize or filter different groups of organizational metrics and view the results as .csv files, including person, meeting, group-to-group,person-to-group, peer comparison, and network queries.

## Data time limit

The historical data that queries use is time limited. You can run queries only on data from the last 27 months. This 27-month period is a _rolling window_. After the first 27 months of [Microsoft 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) is uploaded and processed in Workplace Analytics, it refreshes each week. This means the 27-month extent of data that you can query advances by one week to include the preceding 27 months.

However, historical query results that have already been run remain available, even after the data in the query results passes the 27-month limit.
