# Query designer

The Query designer in Workplace Analytics has a number of different options that help you answer specific business questions and the flexibility to look at the data from multiple perspectives.

* Select as many or as few organizational metrics as you need, for a specific population or date range.
* Customize the metrics included in query results with a broad range of filters and other options.
* Combine query results from different queries to gain even more in-depth insights.

The designer includes the following types of queries.

* [**Templates and reports**](#query-templates) - You can use predefined templates and reports that you can use to view and analyze data in Power BI. These options help you focus your analysis for specific business outcomes, such as to transform meeting culture, enhance organizational resilience, develop effective managers, boost employee engagement, and more.

* [**Custom queries**](#custom-queries) - Select **Get started** in the **Query** section to create a custom query based on the type of organizational data that you want to analyze, such as person, meeting, group-to-group, person-to-group, peer comparison, or network queries. You can then download the query data results as .csv files or depending on the type of data, visualize it directly in Workplace Analytics.

## Reports and templates

In Workplace Analytics, select **Query designer** to see predefined Power BI reports and templates for analyzing data based on behavioral insights that relate to specific business outcomes.

For example, select the **Business continuity** section to see more details about the report, example report data, prerequisites, and setup steps.

You can filter to see what is available for a specific business insight. For example, the following shows what you'll see when you select **Filters** > **Develop effective managers**.

## Custom queries



## Data time limit

The historical data that queries and reports use is time limited. You can run queries only on data from the last 27 months. This 27-month period is a _rolling window_. After the first 27 months of [Microsoft 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) is uploaded and processed in Workplace Analytics, it refreshes each week. This means the 27-month extent of data that you can query advances by one week to include the preceding 27 months.

However, historical query results that have already been run remain available, even after the data in the query results passes the 27-month limit.
