# Power BI templates in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics provides Power BI templates that analysts can use to visually analyze workplace patterns and trends. A Power BI template pre-populates a custom Workplace Analytics query and selects the applicable Power BI charts to show results from these queries.

Workplace Analytics Queries has a number of predefined query templates available. In the preselected filters and metrics section in Queries, you can identify the Power BI templates by the Power BI logo in the upper-right corner of the template:

Workplace Analytics includes the following dashboards that you can use in Power BI to visually analyze data. Select one of the following dashboards to see more details about it and how to set it up:

* [Business continuity](../tutorials/power-bi-bc.md)
* [Collaboration assessment](../tutorials/power-bi-collab-assess.md)
* [Collaboration overload](../tutorials/power-bi-collab-overload.md)
* [Collaboration tracker](../tutorials/power-bi-collab-track.md)
* [Influence insights](../tutorials/pbi-influence-db.md)
* [Manager impact](../tutorials/power-bi-manager-impact.md)

* [Teams insights](../tutorials/power-bi-teams.md)

## Power BI tips

A few tips to help you use these dashboards in Power BI:

* **Cross-filter and cross-highlight** - All visuals on a report page are interconnected. If you select a data point on one of the visuals, all the others on the page that contain that data will change, based on that selection.
* **Drill down into a visual that has a hierarchy** - When a visual has a hierarchy, you can drill down to reveal additional details. Some of the charts in the dashboards support this capability, such as the "By Organization and Level Designation" chart in the Business Continuity dashboard.
* **Export data as a table** – From the upper right corner of any visualization, select **More options** (**…**) and select **Export data**.

For more details about using Power BI, see [Interact with visuals in reports, dashboards, and apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/end-user-visualizations).

## Share a dashboard

Like other products that work with sensitive data, such as HR systems, Workplace Analytics is not meant for the general workforce. Rather, its users are expected to have training regarding how to handle sensitive information. Training should be specific to your organization. See [Data-protection considerations](../privacy/data-protection-considerations.md) when using data generated by Workplace Analytics.

Anyone you share the Power BI *desktop file* with can access the underlying dataset at the same level of granularity as a Workplace Analytics Analyst. For this reason, consider the following alternatives that do not provide access to the underlying data:

* **Share as a PDF or other static file** - This option generates a report that's not interactive. See [Export reports from Power BI to PDF](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/end-user-pdf).
* **Publish the report to Power BI Service and share insights in an app** - This option allows other users to navigate the dashboard without access to the underlying data. See [Distribute insights in an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports#distribute-insights-in-an-app) for details.

## Frequently asked questions

##### Q1 Who can create the dashboard in Power BI?

You must be assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics to create the dashboard. You must also have a Power BI license and have the desktop version installed. See [Install and run Power BI Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-getting-started#install-and-run-power-bi-desktop) for details.

##### Q2 How frequently is data refreshed in the dashboard?

The dashboard gets repopulated once a week after Workplace Analytics finishes its weekend processing. **Note**: You must manually adjust the **Selected time frame** setting in the dashboard's **Settings and scope** report to view the most recently processed data.

##### Q3 How do I share the dashboard with others in my organization?

You can share the dashboard with others in your organization *without sharing the underlying data* by publishing the insights in an app or as PDF or static file. See [Share a dashboard](#share-a-dashboard) for details.

##### Q4 Can I share the underlying dashboard dataset with others in my organization?

To maintain data privacy, only employees assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics should have access to the underlying dataset in the Power BI dashboard.

##### Q5 How do I know if I have the latest version of the template?

Starting with version 2 and later versions of a template, you can find the version number at the end of the title in the lower left of the dashboard’s Settings page.

##### Q6 How can I extend the dates of the query data used in the dashboard?

If you have been using a dashboard for a few months now, you are probably using query data for the last six months. You need to run new queries that include the last one year. For the Business continuity dashboard, see [Template update](../tutorials/power-bi-bc.md#template-update) for details.  

##### Q7 How do I set up and run a Workplace Analytics query?

See [Create a Person Query](./person-queries.md) for details.

##### Q8 How do I change the axis of a chart to use a different Organizational data attribute?

Only the required Organizational attributes are used when setting up the Power BI file. If you selected more Organizational attributes when setting up the queries, you can use those in the visuals. To use a different Organizational attribute:

1. Select the visualization you want to change.  
2. In the **Fields** pane, select and drag the Organizational attribute to the **Axis** section of the visualization.

##### Q9 How do I integrate additional metrics or data sources with this dashboard?

See [Connect to data in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/) to learn more about how to connect data in Power BI. See [Prepare organizational data](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md) to learn about what organizational data you can analyze in Workplace Analytics and see [Data sources](../use/data-sourcesv2.md) to see what data sources you can connect to and analyze from within Workplace Analytics.

##### Q10 How do I use Power BI?

See [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/) for details on how to use Power BI.

##### Q11 What languages is the dashboard available in?

The dashboard is currently only available in English.
