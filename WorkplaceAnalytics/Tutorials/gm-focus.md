# Best practices for focus time

Focused time for deep work provides employees an opportunity to master hard things and produce results at an elite level, in terms of quality and speed.

## Statistics

Every minute spent in a wasteful meeting takes away from solo work thatâ€™s equally essential for creativity and efficiency. In response, people tend to come to work early, stay late, or use weekends for quiet time to concentrate. For about this, see [Stop the Meeting Madness](https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness).

## Best practices

* Proactively schedule blocks of time on your calendar to focus when you know you can do your best work.

* Eliminate as many distractions as possible during a scheduled focus session.

* Schedule focus time with intention by dedicating that time to specific tasks.

* Take a few 15-minute breaks during the day to restore your ability to focus.
