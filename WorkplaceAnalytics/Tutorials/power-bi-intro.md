# Power BI templates in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics provides Power BI templates that analysts can use to visually analyze workplace patterns and trends. A Power BI template pre-populates a custom Workplace Analytics query and selects the applicable Power BI charts to show results from these queries.

Workplace Analytics Queries has a number of predefined query templates available. In the preselected filters and metrics section in Queries, you can identify the Power BI templates by the Power BI logo in the upper-right corner of the template:
