# Best practices for meetings

To solve a problem or make a decision, it helps to keep the meeting audience small and the duration short. Research shows attendees communicate faster, focus on getting the work done and come to decisions more quickly.

## Statistics

Business meetings require participants to commit, focus and make decisions, which depletes our finite cognitive resources. This depletion can lead to poor judgement and bad decisions. Scheduling meetings that are too long or too frequent quickly drains this resource.  Effective meetings are the goal. See [The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) to read more.

## Best practices

* Require meeting agendas, with clear meeting objectives.  
* Keep meetings short, but donâ€™t rush through important conversations either.
* Discourage the use of devices in meetings. It's distracting for those who use the devices and those who participate in the meetings.
* Try holding stand-up meetings. Studies show they are about 34 percent shorter than sit-down meetings, yet produce the same solutions.
* Encourage participation in meetings. It's beneficial for creating more effective meetings and giving participants a way to be heard and considered.
* Avoid holding a meeting just to update people. Decide if an email announcement is enough.
