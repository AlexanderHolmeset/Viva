# Best practices for meetings

To solve a problem or make a decision, it helps to keep the meeting audience small and the duration short. Research shows attendees communicate faster, focus on getting the work done and come to decisions more quickly.

## Statistics

Business meetings require participants to commit, focus and make decisions, which depletes our finite cognitive resources. This depletion can lead to poor judgement and bad decisions. Scheduling meetings that are too long or too frequent quickly drains this resource.  Effective meetings are the goal. See [The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) to read more.

## Best practices

* Clearly define the meeting's purpose and require meeting agendas with clear meeting objectives. See [The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) for more about this best practice.

* Cluster your meetings during portions of the day or days of the week. This'll leave chunks of time open for focusing on independent work or being available to your team for a quick five-minute conversation that would otherwise turn into a complicated email thread or a 30-minute meeting. See [If you multitask during meetings, your team will too](https://insights.office.com/productivity/multitask-meetings-team-will/) for more helpful tips.

* Reduce or cancel recurring meetings that most attendees feel are unnecessary.

* Determine a method for auditing the members in recurring meetings to ensure that only those who are relevant continue to attend. See [Decision-focused meetings](https://www.bain.com/insights/decision-insights-9-decision-focused-meetings) for more information.
