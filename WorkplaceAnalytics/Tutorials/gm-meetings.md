# Best practices for meetings

To solve a problem or make a decision, it helps to keep the meeting audience small and the duration short. Research shows that smaller and shorter meetings enable attendees to communicate faster, come to decisions more quickly, and focus on getting the work done.

## Statistics

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective:

* "If you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."
* "Social psychology research has shown that when people perform group tasks (such as brainstorming or discussing information in a meeting), they show a sizable decrease in individual effort than when they perform alone.”
* "Research shows that there are advantages to keeping [meetings] shorter."
* "Having everyone contribute isn’t just good for creating more effective meetings but for the participants themselves as well."

## Best practices

* Require meeting agendas, with clear meeting objectives.  
* Keep meetings short, but don’t rush through important conversations either.
* Discourage the use of devices in meetings. It's distracting for those who use the devices and those who participate in the meetings.
* Try holding stand-up meetings. Studies show they are about 34 percent shorter than sit-down meetings, yet produce the same solutions.
* Encourage participation in meetings. It's beneficial for creating more effective meetings and giving participants a way to be heard and considered.
* Avoid holding a meeting just to update people. Decide if an email announcement is enough.
