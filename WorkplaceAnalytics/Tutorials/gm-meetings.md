# Best practices for meetings

To solve a problem or make a decision, it helps to keep the meeting audience small and the duration short. Research shows that smaller and shorter meetings enable attendees to communicate faster, come to decisions more quickly, and focus on getting the work done.

## Why it matters

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective:

* "If you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."
* "Social psychology research has shown that when people perform group tasks (such as brainstorming or discussing information in a meeting), they show a sizable decrease in individual effort than when they perform alone.”
* "Research shows that there are advantages to keeping [meetings] shorter."
* "Having everyone contribute isn’t just good for creating more effective meetings but for the participants themselves as well."

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed:

* "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work."  
* "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."
* "64 percent said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking."
* "62 percent said meetings miss opportunities to bring the team closer together."

## Best practices

* Say no to meetings. See the next section for a guide on how to create and share team meeting rules and policy.
* Use [MyAnalytics](../myanalytics/use/mya-notifications.md#shorten-a-meeting) to shorten meetings. For example, when you're composing a meeting invitation with a duration of one hour, an inline suggestion will remind you to shorten the meeting by 15 minutes.
* Invite fewer people. When preparing the agenda, include the purpose of each participant's attendance. This exercise can reveal unnecessary invitees, including people who are optional or only require meeting notes.
* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes. Employees can share meeting notes with decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable [Manager insights in Workplace Analytics](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help managers identify ways to improve team behavior.
* Regularly and openly check in with employees. Frustration, resentment, and even hopelessness are signals that people are falling back into less productive patterns. Changing protocols and behaviors takes time, and sustaining momentum requires consistent attention.
* Assess and discuss progress around meeting habits and its impact on focus. Small, tangible wins provide something for people to celebrate, and small losses provide opportunities for learning and correction.

* Require meeting agendas, with clear meeting objectives.  
* Keep meetings short, but don’t rush through important conversations either.
* Discourage the use of devices in meetings. It's distracting for those who use the devices and those who participate in the meetings.
* Try holding stand-up meetings. Studies show they are about 34 percent shorter than sit-down meetings, yet produce the same solutions.
* Encourage participation in meetings. It's beneficial for creating more effective meetings and giving participants a way to be heard and considered.
* Avoid holding a meeting just to update people. Decide if an email announcement is enough.

## Change strategies

#### Schedule shorter meetings

Work expands to the time allotted for it. Change meeting length defaults from 60 to 45 minutes and from 30 to 25 minutes. Ways to do this:

* Send out a communication informing employees about the downside of endless, back-to-back meetings. Share with them insights around how much collaboration the average employee is experiencing.
* Encourage employees to schedule meetings that have buffers for attendees to capture notes and take a break before their next meeting
* Start yourself, employees will follow the lead of others, especially leaders.

#### Set team meeting rules and policy

* Take an employee survey to gather data and impressions about the organization's meeting frequency and its impact on how much work is or isn't getting done during the day.
* Come together as a team to share everyone's feedback. It's important to process all contributions and analysis from all team members to begin the process of change.
* Agree on a collective, personal goal based on the survey feedback. For example, declare "meeting free" periods to free up time on everyone's calendar. This increases individual focus time and productivity and reduces the spillover into personal time.
* Set standards for when an employee can decline a meeting. Provide a meeting decline template with policy explanations that employees can use to decline meetings based on your team’s meeting rules. For example, "the meeting has no agenda" or "someone from my team is already attending the meeting."
* Create and share your team’s list of meeting rules along with an empowering message that allows employees to say yes or no to meeting invitations they deem valuable or not to attend.
