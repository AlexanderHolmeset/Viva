# Collaboration overload

The Collaboration overload dashboard uses a Power BI template thatâ€™s populated by Workplace Analytics data to identify areas of collaboration overload in your organization. The metrics in this dashboard show where overall collaboration patterns, time fragmentation, or meeting quality could be improved.

* **Collaboration Hours by Level** - Shows the collaboration patterns in your organization for the different roles and levels. Viewing these patterns by level can give you the detail and granularity necessary to identify key trends that can be addressed.
* **Meeting Quality Deep Dive** - The charts provide insights about meetings, such as multitasking, double-booked meetings, and redundancy, that could be impacting overall meeting quality throughout your organization.

To populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must set up and successfully run the predefined **Collaboration overload** query in Workplace Analytics.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the query and populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must:

* Be assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics.
* Have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.

## Set up the dashboard

1. In Workplace Analytics, select **Analyze** > **Queries**.

    If you are not logged in to Power BI, you'll see the current sign-in account highlighted in Power BI. For example, the following shows "Anonymous" as the sign-in account.
