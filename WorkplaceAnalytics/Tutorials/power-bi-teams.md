# Power BI Teams dashboard

You can use the Power BI Teams dashboard populated by Workplace Analytics data to gain insights into how your organization is using Teams to collaborate and get work done.


## Prerequisites  

Before you can run the queries and populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must:

* Be assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics.
* Have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version.
Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.
