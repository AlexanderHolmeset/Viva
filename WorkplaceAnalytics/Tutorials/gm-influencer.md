# Best practices for influencers

Influencers are remarkably successful at driving cross-organizational initiatives and transformations. Ensuring influencer representation across the company can help navigate across hierarchical boundaries and accelerate the execution of growth-focused projects.

## Why it matters

The [Accelerate! How innovative companies can use a strategy network to capitalize on challenges](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/strategy-network-how-innovative-companies-capitalize/) article explains how companies need more volunteer change agents and that:

* "To move faster and further, you need to pull more people than ever before into the strategic change game, but in a way that is economically realistic."
* “Today companies must constantly seek competitive advantage without disrupting daily operations."
* "Strategy should be viewed as a dynamic force that constantly seeks opportunities, identifies initiatives that will capitalize on them, and completes those initiatives swiftly and efficiently."
* "The game is all about vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action, and celebration — not budget reviews, reporting relationships, and compensation."

## Best practices

* Communicate through influencers. Use MyAnalytics network insights to cultivate influence and the [Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections.
* Move cross-functional team collaboration to Microsoft Teams and ask influencer groups to create [Channels in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive the conversations.
* Operate on a “dual operating system” — a management-driven hierarchy working with a strategy network.  
* Recruit volunteers interested in being a part of the organization’s strategy network. Ten percent of the managerial and employee population is enough.  
* A strategy network needs leadership, which focuses on vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action and celebration.
* The strategy network and the hierarchy must be inseparable, with a constant flow of information and activity between them—an approach that works in part because the volunteers in the network all work within the hierarchy.

### Change catalyst: Identify and utilize team influencers

Seek out influencers on your team and leverage their network and ability to share ideas, knowledge, and habits. The following are some ways to do so:

* Look for influencers, or employees who are highly networked.
* Create a small group of influencers to brainstorm what they consider to be the best practices for networking at your company.
* Identify projects that highlight the influencers and projects with opportunities for others to join.
* Communicate the role of influencers and the chosen projects to your whole team.
* Ask the influencers to share a similar message and to encourage their colleagues to connect with someone new.
* Continue the excitement and momentum with regular communications about successful outcomes.
