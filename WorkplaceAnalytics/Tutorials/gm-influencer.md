# Best practices for influencers

Influencers are remarkably successful at driving cross-organizational initiatives and transformations. Ensuring influencer representation across the company can help navigate across hierarchical boundaries and accelerate the execution of growth-focused projects.

## Statistics

The [Accelerate! How innovative companies can use a strategy network to capitalize on challenges](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/strategy-network-how-innovative-companies-capitalize/) article explains how companies need more volunteer change agents and that:

* "To move faster and further, you need to pull more people than ever before into the strategic change game, but in a way that is economically realistic."
* “Today companies must constantly seek competitive advantage without disrupting daily operations."
* "Strategy should be viewed as a dynamic force that constantly seeks opportunities, identifies initiatives that will capitalize on them, and completes those initiatives swiftly and efficiently."
* "The game is all about vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action, and celebration — not budget reviews, reporting relationships, and compensation."

## Best practices

* Operate on a “dual operating system” — a management-driven hierarchy working with a strategy network.  
* Recruit volunteers interested in being a part of the organization’s strategy network. Ten percent of the managerial and employee population is enough.  
* A strategy network needs leadership, which focuses on vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action and celebration.
* The strategy network and the hierarchy must be inseparable, with a constant flow of information and activity between them—an approach that works in part because the volunteers in the network all work within the hierarchy.
