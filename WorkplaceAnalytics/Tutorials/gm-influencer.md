# Best practices for influencers

Influencers are remarkably successful at driving cross-organizational initiatives and transformations. Ensuring influencer representation across the company can help navigate across hierarchical boundaries and accelerate the execution of growth-focused projects.

## Statistics

 “The hierarchical structures and organizational processes we have used for decades to run and improve our enterprises are no longer up to the task of winning in this faster-moving world,” according to [Accelerate! How innovative companies can use a strategy network to capitalize on challenges](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/strategy-network-how-innovative-companies-capitalize/).

## Best practices

* Operate on a “dual operating system”—a management-driven hierarchy working with a strategy network.  
* Recruit volunteers interested in being a part of the organization’s strategy network. Ten percent of the managerial and employee population is enough.  
* A strategy network needs leadership, which focuses on vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action and celebration.
* The strategy network and the hierarchy must be inseparable, with a constant flow of information and activity between them—an approach that works in part because the volunteers in the network all work within the hierarchy.
