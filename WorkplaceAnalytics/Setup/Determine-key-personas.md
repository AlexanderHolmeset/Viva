# Determine key personas

The following describes who does what to identify key personas for the different roles in Workplace Analytics:

 * **Owner** - Workplace Analytics sponsor (the initial point-person for the engagement)
 * **Task** - Identify people in the organization to fill key roles in setting up Workplace Analytics
 * **Outcome** - A list of people in your organization with key roles identified
