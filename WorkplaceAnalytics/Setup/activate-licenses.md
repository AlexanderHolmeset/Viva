# Activate Workplace Analytics licenses

> [!Important]
> You must be a **Global admin** for the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenant to activate licenses with this code.

You can only activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses for a Microsoft 365 or an Office 365 tenant with a code from Microsoft. As the **Global admin** for the tenant, follow these steps to add the code and set up an organization with additional licenses.

### To activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses

1. Start your web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox, for **InPrivate**, **incognito**, or **Private** browsing.

2. Depending on which browser you are using, on the Windows taskbar or Start menu, right-click the browser application and select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.

6. On the **Check out** page, select **Try Now** to confirm the order.
7. When you get the order receipt, save it and then select **Continue**.
8. To confirm that the codes were successfully added to your environment, go to **Admin Center** > **Users** > **Active Users**.

   For example,  https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/users
