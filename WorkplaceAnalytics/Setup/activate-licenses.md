You can only activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses for a Microsoft 365 or an Microsoft 365 tenant with a code from Microsoft. As an Azure Active Directory **License administrator**, follow these steps to add the code and set up an organization with additional licenses.

### To activate additional Workplace Analytics licenses

* **Role** &ndash; Azure Active Directory [License Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#license-administrator)

1. Start your web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox, for **InPrivate**, **incognito**, or **Private** browsing.

2. Open a private browsing session in your web browser. Depending on which browser you are using, right-click it and then select **Start InPrivate Browsing**, **New InPrivate window**, **New incognito window**, or **New private window**.

3. Copy the activation code link, which you received from us, paste it into the URL section of the private or incognito browser window, and then press **Enter** to open the link.
