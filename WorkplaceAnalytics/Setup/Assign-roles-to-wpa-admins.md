# Assign Workplace Analytics roles

The following describes who does what to assign roles in Workplace Analytics for admins, analysts, and program managers:

<!-- CHANGED THIS ON 18 JUNE 2021: 
* **Owner** - Microsoft 365 global administrator
CHANGED THIS TO THE FOLLOWING:  -->

* **Owner** - Azure Active Directory [Privileged Role Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference)
* **Task** - Assign users for administrators and data analysts to Workplace Analytics service.
* **Outcome** - Workplace Analytics roles are assigned so that administrators can use Workplace Analytics to set system defaults, privacy settings, and upload and verify organizational data. After data is provisioned, data analysts can sign in to and use Workplace Analytics.

To allow administrators to set system defaults, privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and to allow data analysts to use Workplace Analytics, you must assign roles to users in the Workplace Analytics service.

You can give managers access to their team's data in Workplace Analytics in [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).

## Workplace Analytics roles and access levels to users

See [User roles](../use/user-roles.md) for detailed role descriptions and access levels.
