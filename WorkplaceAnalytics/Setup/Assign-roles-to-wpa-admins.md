* **Task** - Assign users for administrators and data analysts to Workplace Analytics service.
* **Outcome** - Workplace Analytics roles are assigned so that administrators can use Workplace Analytics to set system defaults, privacy settings, and upload and verify organizational data. And data analysts can log into and use Workplace Analytics after data is provisioned.
