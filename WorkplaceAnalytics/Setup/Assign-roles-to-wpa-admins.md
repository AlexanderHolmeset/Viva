# Assign roles

The following describes who does what to assign roles in Workplace Analytics for admins, analysts, and program managers, so they can use Microsoft Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams and in Workplace Analytics:

<!-- CHANGED THIS ON 18 JUNE 2021: 
* **Owner** - Microsoft 365 global administrator
CHANGED THIS TO THE FOLLOWING:  -->

* **Owner** - Azure Active Directory [Privileged Role Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator)
* **Task** - Assign users for administrators and data analysts to the Workplace Analytics service for Viva Insights.
* **Outcome** - Roles are assigned so that admins can use Workplace Analytics to set system defaults, privacy settings, and upload and verify organizational data. After data is provisioned, analysts can sign in and use Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams and in Workplace Analytics.

Before admins can set system defaults, privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and allow data analysts to use Viva Insights in Teams and in Workplace Analytics, you must assign roles to users in the Workplace Analytics service.

You can give managers access to their team's data in Microsoft Teams in [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).

## Roles and access levels
