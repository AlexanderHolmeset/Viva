# Differential privacy in Workplace Analytics

Privacy can always be guaranteed if no information is revealed, which is not very useful. Similarly, making all information available can lead to high-fidelity metrics that compromise individual privacy. Differential privacy offers a balance between useful information and individual privacy.

Workplace Analytics uses cutting-edge methods from world-class researchers to apply differential privacy. By adding a little bit of noise or changing the data a little bit, allows for useful information with aggregated metrics that keep individually identifiable data private. The methods are more sophisticated than that, with numerous options toward balancing fidelity and privacy.

The first application of differential privacy is with [Insights for people managers](../use/pm-home.md). Workplace Analytics enables you, as an organizational leader to understand how the people in your organization function by using collaboration data, including email, meetings, chats, and instant messages. For details, see [Workplace Analytics metric descriptions](../use/metric-definitions.md).

Workplace Analytics is serious about protecting individual privacy. When computing these metrics, individuals cannot be identified in the data. No matter how these metrics are presented or used, no individual activity or metric can ever be discerned from what you, as an organizational leader or a manager sees. The individual activity can never be established with certainty, and no manager or team-leader can conclude with confidence anything specific about any individual.
