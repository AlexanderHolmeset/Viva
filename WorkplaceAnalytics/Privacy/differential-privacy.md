# Differential privacy technology

Privacy can always be guaranteed if zero information is revealed, but that is not very useful. Similarly, making all information available can lead to high-fidelity metrics, but compromises individual privacy. Differential privacy offers a balance between useful information and individual privacy.

By adding a little bit of noise or changing the data a little bit, allows for aggregated metrics that contain useful information. Because of the added noise, no individually identifiable data can be established with certainty. The methods are more sophisticated than described, and present numerous options toward balancing fidelity and privacy. To learn more about how Microsoft is helping to define and apply it, see [Differential privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/ai-lab-differential-privacy).

## Differential Privacy in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics uses cutting-edge methods from world-class researchers to apply differential privacy for data analysis.  

Workplace Analytics enables you to understand how the people in your organization function by using collaboration data, including email, meetings, chats, and instant messages. For details, see [Workplace Analytics metric descriptions](../use/metric-definitions.md).

Workplace Analytics is serious about protecting individual privacy. When computing the metrics, individuals are unidentifiable in the metrics. The metrics are usefully presented to you as an executive or a manager while keeping individual people de-identified.

No matter how these metrics are presented or used, you cannot establish individual activity or discern anything specific about any individual with confidence. This information is revealed to you as aggregated metrics that reveal trends toward understanding collaboration patterns.
