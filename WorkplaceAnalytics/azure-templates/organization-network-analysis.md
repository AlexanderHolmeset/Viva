# Organizational Network Analysis Azure Template for Workplace Analytics

_This template only available as part of a Microsoft service engagement._

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates include the Organizational Network Analysis template that enables you to visualize connections within your organization, pinpoint collaboration patterns, and drive change.

Workplace Analytics has a few measures to help you visualize and analyze formal and informal relationships within your organization. This analysis can help you shape a business strategy that improves communication, making your business more effective and sustainable.

To focus your analysis on specific subgroups or compare graphs from different time ranges or between different groups, you can create subgroup datasets and graphs within the selected (parent) dataset.

## To add a new dataset

1. In Workplace Analytics Azure Templates, select **Organizational Network Analysis**.
2. On the **Organizational Network Analysis** page, select **Add New Dataset** at top right.
3. In **Define Analysis Settings**, enter a name and select a path to the dataset for analysis.

   ![Add New Analysis](./images/ona-new-dataset.png)

4. In **Grouping Attributes**, select the attributes you want to analyze in the graph. The available attributes match up to the HR attributes included in the imported [organizational data](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md##attribute-reference) from Workplace Analytics.
5. In **Interaction Thresholds**, select the following.

   * **Choose an interaction type**: Select what you want to analyze in the dataset, either email, meeting, or all.
   * **Max Duration Threshold of each interaction**: Select the maximum number of hours for each interaction.
   * **Max # of members involved in each interaction**: Select the maximum number of people involved in each interaction.
   * **Min # of interactions**: Select the minimum number of interactions between the selected groups or people.

6. Optionally, in **Exclusions**, enter one or more terms separated by a comma to exclude meetings with these keywords in the meeting subject line from this analysis. See [meeting exclusion rules](../tutorials/meeting-exclusions-intro.md) to learn more about them.
7. Select **Submit**. Based on the data size, it might take anywhere from a few minutes up to a few hours to successfully create the dataset.
8. After the analysis successfully loads, select the dataset from the list, and then select **Preliminary analysis**.
9. In **Define Graph Settings**, either select filters for the graph, or select no filters to render a graph of all the data unfiltered, and then select **Render Graph**.

10. To save the current graph for future analysis, select **Save**, enter a name, and then select **Save Graph**.

## To add new subgroup analysis

Subgroup analysis enables you to compare or focus your analysis on specific subgroups within the selected dataset.

1. Select the dataset from the list, and then at top right, select **Add New Analysis**.
2. In the **Add New Analysis** pane, enter a name for this subgroup analysis, and then select a start and end date for the time range to analyze.

   ![Add New Analysis](./images/ona-subgroup-analysis.png)

3. Optionally, in **Specify the Network Boundary Condition**, select one or more filters to focus your analysis on.
4. In **Select Employee Level Metrics**, select which employee level metrics, such as Boundary Spanning or Bridging Index to analyze in the graph.
5. In **Select Group Level Metrics**, select the group HR attributes and group metrics to analyze in the combined or grouped view. See [Node Measures](#node-measures) for more details about these options, such as [Reach Index](#reach-index) and [Influence Index](#influence-index).
6. For **Compute Options**, you can select to generate both network and group level metrics to get both the aggregated calculations for the whole date range and the monthly measure calculations for the selected date range. If you don't select this option, you won't get the monthly metrics.
7. Select **Submit** to create the graph analysis. The system will process the analysis, which is complete when the Status changes to a green check mark.

## To view analysis

1. After the analysis successfully loads (green check mark), select it from the list, and then:

   * For new analysis, select **Render Graph**.
   * For previously saved analysis (graphs), select **Load Saved Graph** (top right), and then select it from the list.

   >Note:
   >If no analysis has been saved yet, the list will be empty.

2. At top of the graph, you can select a new start and end date for the time range to analyze, and then select **Apply** to update the graph view.

3. Use the following options to change the graph view and save new analysis.

   Option |Name |Description
   ------------|--------------|------------
   ![ONA no measure](./images/ona-no-measure.png)| No Measure | Changes how the data is measured and shown in the graph based on the Node Size option you select.
   ![ONA legend](./images/ona-legend.png)| Show or Hide Legend  | Opens or closes the legend of assigned node colors for the HR attribute shown in the graph.
   ![ONA link color](./images/ona-link-color.png) | Link Color |Select a different color for the line links shown in the graph.
   ![ONA dataset parameters](./images/ona-dataset-parameters.png) | Dataset Parameters |Choose to view the network parameter details that you set for the selected dataset.
   ![ONA network view](./images/ona-network-icons-3.png)| Network View  | Changes how the graph shows the network, which you can view in these layouts: <ul><li> Force-directed - Assigns forces among the set of edges and nodes, so they overlap as little as possible and are distributed evenly. This is a good overall view for any kind or size  of data and is useful for finding patterns and symmetries.</li><li> Organic - Spreads nodes and links apart, so multiple components are laid out in a circular arrangement with larger components in the center to help reveal underlying structures.  </li><li> Tweak - Tries to keep nodes where they are when changing measures or other graph options. This is useful for dynamic and evolving data where you donâ€™t want to rearrange the whole network or lose your mental data map for small changes.</li></ul>|
   ![ONA combined view](./images/ona-combined-view-icon.png) |Combined or Grouped View | Change the graph view to Combined or Grouped View, which prompts you to select an HR attribute metric to display the nodes for, such as FunctionType.
   ![OnA change color nodes](./images/ona-color-icon.png) | Changes Node Colors | You can select to change the color of any of the nodes shown in the graph.
   ![ONA change settings](./images/ona-settings.png) | Changes Settings |Scales the thickness or color darkness of the link lines. You can also use this to turn node labels and tool tips on or off.
   ![ONA filter](./images/ona-filter-icon.png) | Filter by HR attributes |Changes the filters that show in the rendered graph. This doesn't change the dataset filters or recalculate the dataset metrics. If you want to calculate new metrics for a subset, you must create a new subset of the dataset.
   ![ONA save graph](./images/ona-save.png) | Save Graph |Choose to save this graph as shown to load and view later.

## To view a saved graph

1. On the **Organizational Network Analysis** page, select the name of the dataset in the table, and then select the name of the graph in the table.
2. At the top right of **Define Graph Settings**, select **Load Saved Graph**.
3. Select the name of the graph that you want to view. If no analysis has been created, the subset list will be empty.
4. Additional information and options on the analysis pages:

   * When the **Status** is a green check mark, the graph analysis was successfully saved and can be viewed.
   * If the analysis fails with the **Status** of a red x, select the **Job Details** (i) icon next to Status to view details and see what might've caused the failure.
   * Select a table column heading, such as Name or Submitted, to sort by it.
   * Select the **Parameters** icon next to the name to view them for the analysis in that row.
   * Select the **Delete Analysis** (trashcan) icon to delete the analysis from the list.
   * Select the **Download Metrics** icon to download an .xlsx file with the person and group metrics in the saved subgroup graph analysis, which are based on the selected date range and other options. For example, Boundary Spanning will have multiple values based on the attributes selected for the graph.

## Node Measures

Each dot or node in the template's network graph represents either an employee or a group. The lines between the nodes represent connections, which are collaborative relationships between the connected employees or groups.

The node measures for employees are de-identified to maintain their privacy. Group node measures represent the group's measures, such as for a department (Sales) or a functional group (program managers) within the organization.

You can size the nodes and connections based on what you want to highlight by using the Scale Nodes option (No Measure by default) at the top. The following shows the measures available in a *Network View* of the graph:

![Network View measures](./images/ona-combined-measures.png)

And the measure options available for the *Combined or Grouped View* of the graph, which include Density as an additional Scale Node option thatâ€™s only available in this view:

![Combined or Grouped View measures](./images/ona-network-measures.png)

### Boundary Spanning

Boundary Spanning measures the extent to which employees act as a representative of their group  across the organization. It indicates how people or groups are connecting to and sharing information with others in the organization.

Based on a defined group, Boundary Spanning measures the time an employee or group spends collaborating with other groups, with a boost for the diversity of their connections (number of groups). This does not consider ties inside their own group.

The network boundary is the largest group within your dataset. People that don't meet the filter conditions are excluded from the analysis. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#boundary-spanning).

### Bridging Index

Bridging Index is the number of times a person or group is on the most probable path of information flow between two other people or groups. Meaning these nodes represent the potential control over the flow of information in your organization.

High values can indicate gatekeepers, liaisons, or change agents. Can be advantageous or stressful playing this role. The periphery may be less influenced by others. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#bridging-index).

### Degrees

Degrees measures the highest number of links to other nodes within the network. Nodes with a high degree of links are those people or groups who have the best connections to others in the network. These people or groups can be key influencers or might just be strategically important for communication.

Degree centrality is based on the number of edges connected to a node. The overall degree is the number of incoming and outgoing edges connected to a node. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#degrees).

### Density

This option is only available in the Grouped View. Density measures the number of actual connections out of the number of possible connections within a network or subgroup in a table view. Higher density indicates higher levels of connectivity. Large groups tend to have small values since itâ€™s more difficult for everyone to connect with everyone else, so be cautious when comparing across groups. Dense groups indicate cohesion between members. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#density).

### Influence Index

Represents the number of links each person or group (node) has and the number of links their connections have, and so on throughout the network. The larger nodes represent the people or groups with high centrality and therefore, are considered key influencers in their network. Influence occurs from these influencers sharing information to their network, who then forward it to theirs, and so on. High values suggest the central person's or groupâ€™s perspective will flow through the organization with efficiency. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#influence-index).

### Reach Index

Represents the ability to access or share information across the organization while going through minimal intermediaries. Closeness Centrality calculates the average distance between a person<!-- or group--> and others in the network. People nodes with a high closeness value have a lower distance to all other nodes and therefore are efficient broadcasters of information. For more details, see the [measure calculations](ona-metric-calculations.md#reach-index).

> [!Note]
> Weights are not factored into Reach Index computations. Also, group-level measures are not yet available for Reach Index.

### Graph notes

* **Insufficient group size** - If one or more nodes represent groups that are smaller than the set Minimum Group Size, they're combined and listed as an insufficient group (such as in the color node list). For the grouped or combined view, the insufficient group's edges and node won't show in the graph.

* **Delete a node** - If you want to exclude a node from the graph, you can use the filter options or select the node in the graph to highlight it, and then press **Delete** (on your keyboard). Before saving the graph, you can right-click in the graph, and then select **Show Hidden** to undo a delete.
