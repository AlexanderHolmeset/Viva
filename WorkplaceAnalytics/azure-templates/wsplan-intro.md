# Workspace planning tool

Workspace planning helps you identify and seat teams together in a workspace that maximizes and fosters cross-team productivity and collaboration. You can use this tool to generate floor plans quickly and objectively, in a data-driven way that optimizes employee collaboration by seating teams together.

The algorithm for this Workspace planning tool accounts for the following rules and constraints:

* **Teams stay together** - When a workspace can seat everyone on the team, it will keep them all together.
* **Teams who collaborate the most sit together** - Based on the collaboration patterns and the distances between spaces, if team A spends most of its time with team B, the two teams are assigned workspaces that are as close together as possible.
* **The most central team is in the most central workspace** - As lower priority than the previous two, the tool can help you determine which floor plans are better than others for seating specific teams in central locations.
* **Everyone gets a seat** - All team members get an assigned seat in a workspace.
* **People and seat assignments must match** - No workspace is assigned more people than it has seats for and no workspace can have a negative number of people assigned to seats.

You can create seating plans that require different variables, such as the following.

* Colocate teams who collaborate the most with each other within the same multi-floored building that has multiple zones or neighborhoods.
* Cross-team collaboration around constraints for specific teams. For example, the HR team must be colocated on the first floor in the same neighborhood and Zone A must be next to the file room.
* Create seating for alternating or rotating work schedules for teams who share a workspace on different weeks or days.
