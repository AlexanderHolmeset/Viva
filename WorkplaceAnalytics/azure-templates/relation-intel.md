# Relationship Intelligence

_This template is only available as part of a Microsoft service engagement._

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates includes the Relationship Intelligence report for Power BI. You can use this report to analyze relationships your organization has with collaborators external to the company, such as relationships with customers or partners.

Workplace Analytics has a variety of measures to help you visualize and analyze formal and informal relationships within your organization. This report can help you understand how internal groups are communicating and spending their time with ***external*** collaborators.

This report uses account and contact information from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, such as Dynamics or Salesforce. The CRM data provides account-level focus and insights into relationship patterns. If no account or contact data is available, it analyzes external domain-level collaboration as a proxy for accounts.

The Relationship Intelligence report includes the following.

* **Relationship Overview** - Shows information about all accounts, including:

  * The Account table includes an overview of related collaboration activity with accounts, such as email and meeting hours spent with them and the last date the organization engaged with them.
  * The **Connectivity Score** is based on the amount, frequency, and timeliness of collaboration activity with an account. The scores are divided into the following values that can be filtered into any combination.

    * Low: 1 to 29
    * Medium: 30 to 79
    * High: 80 to 100
  
  * The **Account size** filters are based on the estimated number of people in your organization who interacted with or contacted customer accounts. The sizes are divided into the following values that can be filtered into any combination.

    * XS: 1 to 2 contacts
    * X: 3 to 9 contacts
    * M: 10 to 49 contacts
    * L: 50 to 99 contacts
    * XL: 100 to 499 contacts
    * XXL: 500 or more contacts

  * The **Connectivity tiers** categorize each account into one of the following percentiles out of all of the accounts the organization engages with, which you can filter down to any combination of tiers.

    * Bottom 5 percent
    * Bottom 25 percent
    * Bottom 50 percent
    * Top 50 percent
    * Top 25 percent
    * Top 10 percent
    * Top 5 percent

  * The **Connectivity rank by account size** ranks each account by comparing its connectivity score with all the other accounts of a comparable size that your organization interacts with. You might see rank ties between one or more accounts who have the same connectivity score and the same size designation.
  * Page down to see **Relationship Highlights** > **Total Time Spent** chart and a chart with **Distinct contacts** analysis.
  * Use the **Internal Group Settings** on the Settings page to focus the chart analysis (below the filter) to specific internal groups who are collaborating. The **Group Engagement** and **Collaboration Time** charts show more details about overall account collaboration activity.

* **Account Analysis** - Focuses on the following details about an account that you selected and drilled through from the first page:

  * See visuals about the average **Connectivity Score** and how the score has changed over the selected time and how metrics contributing to the score have changed over the same time period.
  * Examine the collaboration visuals on this page to see what type of communication has occurred with contacts over time and who the top individual account contacts are that the organization has collaborated with. The second table lists the top internal groups in the organization who have collaborated with an account based on the Internal Group Settings values from the Settings page.
  * Investigate the **Topics** section to see the main topics in a word cloud that indicate what collaboration activity was focused on for the selected account. The topics are based on the subject lines for meetings and email. Use the **Time Range Selection** to see how the topics in the word cloud change based on what date range is selected.
  * You'll also see visuals for collaboration trends by communication type for the selected account over the selected time period.

* **Individual Collaborators** - Shows more details about all the individual account contacts and all the organizational groups that have collaborated with these contacts. The tables include the Connectivity Score and other details about how your organization is collaborating with individual account contacts for the selected account.
* **External Collaborators** - Shows more details about the external collaborator that you selected from the Individual Collaborators page. It shows details about a person outside the organization that collaborated with one or more of the organizational groups. It focuses on details, such as their most recent Connectivity Score, Influencer rank (how connected an individual is at the external company), group engagement, and collaboration time.
* **Domain Details** - Shows details about any individuals included in the data that missing or incorrect CRM or account data.

## Steps to create the report

3. [Add new analysis](#add-new-analysis) - Follow the steps to create the dataset in Workplace Analytics Azure Templates that the Power BI report uses.
4. [Load the data and view the report](#load-the-data-and-view-the-report) - Follow the steps to download the Power BI template and load the data in Power BI. You can then use Power BI to visualize the data and drill in and focus on account details.

## Prerequisites

* **CRM data** –  Accounts and contacts exported as .csv files from your CRM, such as Microsoft Dynamics or Salesforce. See [Required CRM file formats](deploy-configure.md#required-crm-file-formats) for details about what the files must include based on the type of CRM.
* **Data export** - The Workplace Analytics admin must include  **ExternalCollaboratorIDs** and *unhashed* **Subject lines** in the [Data export from Workplace Analytics](data-export.md#to-export-data). The subject lines are required to view topic results from your organization's email and meetings in the report. If this data is unavailable, that section of the report will show no data.
* **Power BI Desktop** - Have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed locally. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.
