# Relationship intelligence report

_These templates are only available as part of a Microsoft service engagement._

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates includes the Relationship Intelligence Power BI report. You can use this report to analyze relationships your organization has with collaborators external to the company, such as relationships with customers or partners.

Workplace Analytics has a variety of measures to help you visualize and analyze formal and informal relationships within your organization, this report can help you understand how internal groups are communicating and spending their time with external collaborators.

This report requires account and contact information from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, such as Dynamics or Salesforce. This report uses CRM data to provide account-level focus and insights into relationship patterns.
