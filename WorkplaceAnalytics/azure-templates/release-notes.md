## August 2019

The following new template and template enhancements are now available.

### Process Explorer Azure Template

This release adds a new Process Explorer template that helps you understand where your organization or team is investing or expending valuable time. You can use this template to categorize processes, projects, meetings, and other activities. You can either upload a .csv dataset for meeting activity or connect to a blob storage location for meeting and email activity.

To learn more, see [Process Explorer Azure Template](./process-explorer.md).

### Organizational Network Analysis Azure Template

The following enhancements and features are included in the Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) Azure Template.

#### Comparative analysis

With the ONA template, you can now view and compare two networks side by side with two browser windows, such as to compare:

* Two different time periods to see how a network has evolved (before and after analysis)
* Between different metrics, such as betweenness and intersectionality, for the same time period
* Two different filters, such as by job title and level designation, for the same time period

#### Density measure

You can now analyze cohesion within groups and across groups by density, which is a new measure in the ONA template. This table view depicts the density score within and across the respective groups.

#### Save and view saved graphs

You can now save a data analysis graph in the template, and then view it as a saved graph later.

To learn more, see [Organizational Network Analysis Azure Template](./organization-network-analysis.md).
