# Data analysis in Workplace Analytics

Workplace Analytics enables analysts to provide business leaders with unprecedented insights about how people spend their time, and who they spend it with. These insights empower business leaders to drive strategies for sales, employee engagement, and productivity initiatives.

You can explore the data with the Workplace Analytics dashboards, and dive deeper into your company's behavioral metrics by using custom queries and query templates.

Workplace Analytics provides the following ways to analyze and explore your data.

[**Home**](../use/home-page.md) provides analysis scope information and research-based behavioral insights into how your organization gets work done, such as enhance organizational agility, boost employee engagement, improve agility, and foster innovation. As a new user, you will only see the [new Admin setup experience](../setup/Set-up-Workplace-Analytics.md) until you get Workplace Analytics set up for the first time.

**Analyze** includes the following data-analysis tools:

* [**Peer analysis**](../use/peer-analysis.md) helps you discover the unique workplace collaboration patterns that the most effective people in your organization use to succeed. You can then use these insights to teach and foster these work patterns throughout your company.

* [**Queries**](../tutorials/query-basics.md) help you investigate organizational data to answer specific questions. The different query types of Person, Meeting, Group-to-group, and Person-to-group give you flexibility to look at data from multiple perspectives and generate powerful insights.

[**Explore the stats**](../use/explore-intro.md) data helps you analyze organizational data trends that are summarized by week, for meetings, by network connections, for management and coaching, and for external collaboration.

[**Plans**](../tutorials/solutionsv2-intro.md) currently provide a _Teamwork improvement_ plan that enables teams to build better collaboration habits and master their time by using the combined power of Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics. You can use Workplace Analytics to discover what challenges teams are struggling with, such as collaboration overload, and then enroll them in action plans to help address these challenges.

[**Settings**](../use/settings.md) in Workplace Analytics includes the following:

* [Sources](../use/settings.md#sources) – View information about the Office 365 and organizational data that's been uploaded into Workplace Analytics.
* [Upload](../use/settings.md#upload) – Prepare and upload organizational and customer data.
* [Analysis settings](../use/settings.md#analysis-settings) – Customize meeting exclusion rules to help ensure data accuracy.
* [Admin settings](../use/settings.md#admin-settings) – Configure system defaults, privacy settings, and manager settings.
