# Manager settings

As the Workplace Analytics Admin, you can set up and edit **Manager settings** to allow all measured people managers or a specified group of managers access to aggregate collaboration insights about their team and the ability to start plans for their team in Workplace Analytics. Only managers whose team meets or exceeds the **Minimum team size** setting can access Workplace Analytics. The size of the team counts the manager and all the employees who directly or indirectly report to that manager within the organization's reporting hierarchy.

The following are based on the latest organizational (HR) data that's been successfully uploaded and processed in Workplace Analytics:

* **Measured managers** - Total number of people managers who are assigned licenses in Workplace Analytics.
* **Managers enabled** - Total number of people managers who meet the minimum team size and have access to their team's insights and plans in Workplace Analytics.

**Owner** â€“ Only Workplace Analytics Admins have full access to this page. For details, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).

* **Minimum team size** - You can set the minimum size of a team that a manager is allowed to view insights about and start plans for. The minimum size allowed is 10. This section also shows you how many measured managers currently have teams that are equal to or more than the minimum setting.
* **Insights and plans** - You can select to allow all licensed managers access to aggregated collaboration insights about their teams and to start and manage plans for their teams. Or you can upload a .csv file that lists the email addresses for the managers you want to give access to their team's insights and plans in Workplace Analytics.
<!-- REMOVING (12/4/2020) FOR NOW. REINSTATE PERHAPS IN JANUARY 2021. 
  * If you turn **Insights and plans** on, your organizational hierarchy file will also be used to power personal insights for managers in the [Insights add-in](../myanalytics/use/add-in.md), the [MyAnalytics dashboard](../myanalytics/use/dashboard-2.md), and other MyAnalytics surfaces. This file will complement hierarchy information from Azure AD. If a manager in your organization has team members who are listed in both Azure AD and Workplace Analytics, the system will default to using the Workplace Analytics data; otherwise it will use whichever source is available.
   
     Personal insights help managers improve their personal impact on and relationships with direct reports, and are powered exclusively by information from the manager's own Outlook mailbox. Learn more about personal insights for people managers in [Assistance for people managers](../myanalytics/overview/privacy-guide.md#assistance-for-people-managers). -->

## To configure manager settings

> [!Important]
> Only Workplace Analytics Admins can access **Manager settings**. Also, before managers can access Workplace Analytics, they must be assigned a Workplace Analytics license and have a team that meets or exceeds the **Minimum team size** setting.

1. In **Settings** > **Admin settings** > **Manager settings**, select to change the switch **On** to allow managers with the minimum team size access to their team data in Workplace Analytics.
2. Select one of the following:

   * **All managers** - Allows all measured managers access.
   * **Select managers** (upload .csv) - Enables you to give specific managers access. You then need to:

      a. Create a .csv file that lists the email addresses for the select managers.

      b. Select **Upload .csv** to upload this list.

3. If you're allowing all managers access, continue to **Step 4**. If setting up access for select managers, select **Download currently enabled manual upload manager list .csv** to confirm which managers now have access. If an error occurs, such as an invalid email or an unlicensed manager, the .csv file will show the error for that manager.
4. In **Minimum team size**, you can change the minimum to a number more than 10 (which is the lowest setting allowed), which limits access to only those managers who have teams equal to or more than that number.
5. Select **Save**.
