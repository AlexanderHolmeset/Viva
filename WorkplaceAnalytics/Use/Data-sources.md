# Data sources

   >[!Note]
   >You must be assigned either the administrator or the analyst role to access the **Data sources** page. For more information, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).

**Data sources** contains high-level dashboard views that Workplace Analytics administrators and data analysts can use to verify that Office 365 and organizational data is loaded and ready to use.

Data sources includes the following:

 * [Data sources summary](#data-sources-summary) is an overview of the source mailboxes and collaborators that make up the data set.
 * [Office 365 data summary](#office-365-data-summary) shows the overall trend of email and meeting hours and volume in the data set.
 * [Organizational data summary](#organizational-data-summary) provides information about the Organizational Attributes that are in the data set.
 * [CRM data](#crm-data) is available after you upload and process CRM data in Workplace Analytics.

Using Data sources metrics, Workplace Analytics administrators and data analysts can:

* Get a high-level view of the data that is available for analysis.
* Verify that the organizational data they need for their specific analysis is available, and work with internal suppliers of the data (HR information system administrators, line of business [LOB] system administrators, and data analysts) to verify the necessary data has been loaded as expected.
* Verify that the data is of sufficient quality to analyze the business problem.

## Data sources summary

The Data sources summary provides the following information about your data:

* The number of **measured employees** for whom your Workplace Analytics administrator assigned licenses during setup. After license assignments, Workplace Analytics extracts Office 365 data about meetings, email, unscheduled calls, and instant messages for these people. When the data extraction process is successful for these employees, they are included in your measured population. If extraction errors occur and Workplace Analytics didn't get data for a person, that person is licensed but not counted as a measured employee in Workplace Analytics. If you are an analyst or limited analyst, this is the population that you can analyze within Workplace Analytics. The number of measured employees can help determine whether you have good data coverage for analysis.

* The number of people not part of your measured population (both internal and external) with whom the measured employees collaborated.

* The date range of the Office 365 data. Use this range to verify if you have data for the period you want to analyze.

* The organizational data coverage for measured employees and other internal collaborators. This can tell you if you have loaded enough attributes about your population to allow accurate filtering and grouping of data, and for all metrics to be computed correctly.

For more information about what data is needed to compute metrics, see these topics:

* [Prepare organizational data](../setup/Prepare-organizational-data.md)

* [Metric definitions](../Use/Metric-definitions.md)

* [Glossary](../Use/Glossary.md)

## Office 365 data summary

Office 365 data summary provides a view that you can use to evaluate meeting and email collaboration data levels over a given time period. It provides a view of average weekly meeting and email hours, sent emails, and meetings attended over time. The Last refreshed date shows when data was most recently processed.

Analysts can use these views to look for time periods that have unexpected gaps in activity, inconsistent or degraded data, or activity levels that are higher or lower than what might be considered normal for your organization.

![Data sources summary](../images/wpa/Use/o365-data.png)

The following are examples of where you might encounter inconsistency in email or meeting volume.

* **Major holidays**: Drops in email and meeting activity around major holidays is typical and can potentially impact analysis. You can remove these weeks from your outputs to reduce its impact.

* **Email archive policies**: Business policies can impact historical data processed during initial setup. As you view historical data, if you see a steady decline or point-in-time drop-off in email and/or meeting activity, it may be due to archiving. Using this view, you can select a time period where the mail volume is stable.

* **Recurring meetings**: When a recurring meeting series is removed from a calendar, all past instances of this meeting are removed. As you view historical data, if you see a steady decline in meeting activity, it may be due to recurring meetings having been removed from calendars.

## Organizational data summary

Organizational data summary provides details about the attributes that have been supplied, as well as the population coverage for each of the attributes (coverage is defined as the percentage of measured employees who have a value specified for the given attribute).

![Data sources summary](../images/wpa/Use/organizational-data-summary.png)

The **Last refreshed** date shows when data was last processed.

### Values

A list of the attributes provided by your organization. When you [create queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md), you can filter and group employees in the organization by using the attributes, so being familiar with these attributes will help give insight into the types of queries you may want to create for analysis.

### Measured employees

The number of employees for whom your Workplace Analytics administrator assigned licenses to during setup. Workplace Analytics collects meeting and email data about these people. As an Analyst or Limited Analyst, this is the population you can analyze within Workplace Analytics.

### Coverage

The percentage of measured employees who have a value specified for the given attribute. If coverage levels are low, it will be difficult to determine how people collaborate across different characteristics. Additionally, low coverage on required attributes may give skewed (under reported) metric calculations for metrics that rely on those attributes.

### Unique values

The count of the unique attribute values included in the data. For example, if the attribute Region contains North, South, Central, East, West and Southwest, itâ€™s unique values count is six.

## CRM data

This page provides a high-level view of the latest available CRM data that was uploaded and successfully processed in Workplace Analytics. It includes the number of accounts, contacts, and seller assignments that are available for data analysis.

By combining this data in Workplace Analytics, you can now analyze how sales activities connect to organizational outcomes. For example, you could analyze if the time your sales team spent with various accounts is proportionate to the revenue potential of those accounts, or if your top tier accounts are getting enough attention from your sales team.

The **Join coverage** section describes the percent overlap between the uploaded list of accounts and the other uploaded lists of important CRM data, such as contacts and seller assignments, as shown in the following graphic. The higher the percentage overlap the more accurate analysis you can accomplish.

![CRM data sources page](../images/wpa/Use/crm-sources.png)

For join coverage based on the latest data uploads, you might see one of the following important notices, as shown in the following graphic.

* **Data is not associated**: This occurs when one or more attributes cannot be associated between the two sets of data for join coverage. You can select to download a .csv file and view the contacts or sellers that can't be associated with the corresponding accounts in the accounts table.
* **Data has not been processed**: This occurs when an upload hasn't been done yet, the data is currently being processed, or something failed during the validation or data processing phase. You can select the link to the Upload page and view the status of the upload, correct any issues, or upload new data. You can also ignore this warning if you don't plan to upload that specific data file.

![CRM join notices](../images/wpa/Use/crm-join-notices.png)

You can select one of the data titles, such as accounts or contacts, to view a list of attributes for it. For example, the following shows a list of attributes for contacts.

![View CRM attributes for contacts](../images/wpa/Use/crm-contact-attributes.png)

Similar to the Organizational data page, the CRM data attributes list includes the following.

* **Data upload date**: Shows when the data was last uploaded and processed, which is at the top of the list.
* **Attribute**: Lists the attributes provided in the uploaded data. When you [create queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md), you can filter and group accounts with a few of these attributes, so being familiar with these helps give insight into the types of queries you might want to create for analysis.
* **Employees with this attribute**: Depending on what data you're looking at, this shows the number of people that have that attribute in that data file. For example, the following graphic shows the number of contacts that have a non-blank value for that attribute.
* **Coverage**: Shows the percentage of attributes that have non-blank values. For example, in following graphic, 87.5% or 7 out of 8 accounts have non-blank values for the **AccountAnnualRevenue** attribute.
* **Unique values**: The count of the unique attribute values included in the data.

>[!Note]
> You can select a column name to sort the list by it in descending or ascending order.

To view a list of the top 100 values for an attribute, select the attribute's name from the list. For example, the following graphic shows the top values for **AccountId** in an accounts data file.

* To view the list for a different attribute, select it from the list at the top of the table.
* You can select a column title to sort the list by that column in descending or ascending order.
* Type a keyword in the **Search** field to search all attributes that include that keyword, such as email or phone.
