# Explore

Explore in Workplace Analytics includes the following set of analytical cards as a starting point to gain quick insights into your organization's data and to identify data you'll want to investigate further.

### Metrics overview

* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-teams.md) shows insights and communication trends about how your organization's employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

### Analyze and start Solutions

* [**Peer analysis**](../use/peer-analysis.md) helps you discover the unique workplace-collaboration patterns that the most effective people in your organization use to succeed. You can then use these insights to teach and foster these work patterns throughout your company.

### Time limit for Explore data

<!-- ORIGINAL: The historical data that populates the various **Explore** pages is time limited: These charts reflect data that is no older than 27 months. This 27-month period is a _rolling window_. This means that&mdash;after you have 27 months of data&mdash;with each month that passes, the 27-month limit of data that support the **Explore** pages advances by one month.  -->

The historical data that populates the various **Explore** pages is time limited and the charts reflect data that is no older than 27 months. This 27-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Office 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the 27-month extent of data that the **Explore** page reflects advances by one week.
