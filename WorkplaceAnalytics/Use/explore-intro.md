## Data time limit

The historical data that populates **Explore the stats** is time limited; the charts reflect data that is from the last six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Office 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data reflected in **Explore the stats** advances by one week.

<!-- REMOVED 13 OCT 2020 per Danny, Daysha
To request a historical-data period longer than six months for your organization, contact Customer Support for Workplace Analytics. -->
