# Explore the stats

Explore the stats data in Workplace Analytics gives you a starting point with quick insights about your organization and to identify data you'll want to investigate further.

The following are available through the recommendations within **See your insights** in the [**Take action**](insights.md#take-action) section of a related insight. However, you can also bookmark a direct link to each. For example, go to [Meetings overview](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/Home/Agility/MeetingsOverview) to view it in Workplace Analytics.

* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) summarizes day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) summarizes meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) summarizes collaboration between leaders, managers, and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) summarizes employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-teams.md) shows communication trends about how your employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

## Data time limit

The historical data that populates **Explore the stats** is time limited; the charts reflect data that is no older than six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Office 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data reflected in **Explore the stats** advances by one week.

<!-- REMOVED 13 OCT 2020 per Danny, Daysha
To request a historical-data period longer than six months for your organization, contact Customer Support for Workplace Analytics. -->
