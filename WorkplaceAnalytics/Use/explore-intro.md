# Explore the stats

Explore the stats in Workplace Analytics give you a starting point to gain quick insights into your organization's data and to identify data you'll want to investigate further.

The left navigation has changed in recent releases of Workplace Analytics, which is not reflected in this video recording. Explore the stats data is accessible through the recommendations shown for **See your insights** in the **Take action** section of a related insight. For example, to see **Meetings overview** data, select **Improve agility** > **Organize better meetings** > **See your insights** > **Explore the stats**.

## Analyze and start Plans

* [**Peer analysis**](../use/peer-analysis.md) helps you discover the unique workplace-collaboration patterns that the most effective people in your organization use to succeed. You can then use these insights to teach and foster these work patterns throughout your company.

## Explore the stats

* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-teams.md) shows insights and communication trends about how your organization's employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

## Data time limit

The historical data that populates **Explore the stats** is time limited; the charts reflect data that is from the last six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Office 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data reflected in **Explore the stats** advances by one week.

<!-- REMOVED 13 OCT 2020 per Danny, Daysha
To request a historical-data period longer than six months for your organization, contact Customer Support for Workplace Analytics. -->
