## Analyze and start Plans

* [**Peer analysis**](../use/peer-analysis.md) helps you discover the unique workplace-collaboration patterns that the most effective people in your organization use to succeed. You can then use these insights to teach and foster these work patterns throughout your company.

## Metrics overview

* [**Week in the life**](../use/explore-metrics-week-in-the-life.md) gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](../use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview.md) gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md) gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-teams.md) shows insights and communication trends about how your organization's employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

## Time limit for Explore data

The historical data that populates the various **Explore** pages is time limited; the charts reflect data that is no older than six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Office 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data that the **Explore** page reflects advances by one week.

<!-- REMOVED 13 OCT 2020 per Danny, Daysha
To request a historical-data period longer than six months for your organization, contact Customer Support for Workplace Analytics. -->
