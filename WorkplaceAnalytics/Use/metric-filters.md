# Metric filters

To customize the results from Workplace Analytics [queries](../tutorials/query-basics.md), you use metrics (see [metric definitions](metric-definitions.md)).

After you select a metric for a query, you can narrow the focus of that metric by applying filters. You can also rename the metric to indicate the new focus that you gave when you applied filters; its new name will appear in the query results. See [Apply a metric filter](#apply-a-metric-filter).

## Meeting filters

| Filter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |

When you select an attendee-exclusion rule, you redefine meeting attendance to include or exclude the cases of “tentative” and “no response.” Therefore, based on the attendee-exclusion rule that you have selected, Total attendees can mean one of the following: <br> <ul> <li>Total attendees = Total accepted </li> <li>Total attendees = Total accepted + Total no response </li> <li>Total attendees = Total accepted + Total tentatively accepted </li> <li>Total attendees = Total accepted + Total no response + Total tentatively accepted </li> </ul> |

## Participant filters

Filters of the following types can be used in various query types to filter participants in collaboration activities &ndash; that is, in emails, IMs, calls, or meetings.

### Individual participant filters

| Filter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Is Manager Present   | A Boolean that indicates that the participant is the direct manager of the measured user. | 
| Is Direct Report Present  | Indicates that the participant is the direct report of the measured user. | 

### Groups of participant filters

Organizational-data attributes and CRM attributes can also be used as participant filters. 


| Filter  | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Organizational attributes (required) | Organizational attributes that are [required](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md#required-attributes) are always available for use as participant filters. |
| Organizational attributes (optional) | Also available for use as participant filters are optional organizational attributes ([reserved optional attributes](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md#reserved-optional-attributes) and [custom attributes](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md#custom-attributes)) that have been uploaded in an [organizational data upload](../setup/upload-organizational-data.md). |
| CRM attributes (required) | CRM attributes that are [required](../setup/crm-data-upload.md#required-and-reserved-attributes) are available for use as participant filters in query types that permit both organizational and CRM data analysis (person, person-to-group, and group-to-group queries). | 
| CRM attributes (optional) | Optional CRM attributes ([reserved optional attributes](../setup/crm-data-upload.md#required-and-reserved-attributes) and [custom attributes](../setup/crm-data-upload.md#custom-attributes)) are available for use as participant filters in query types that permit both organizational and CRM data analysis (person, person-to-group, and group-to-group queries). |

## Apply a metric filter

In this example procedure, you apply a filter to a metric in a person query. Specifically, you restrict the _Email sent_ metric to include only email that was sent during a particular time of day. Then, for the population of employees that you specify, the query results will show the number of emails that were sent during the time of day that you selected.

1. In Workplace Analytics, select **Analyze** > **Queries** > **Person**.

2. Under **Select metrics**, select **Emails sent**:

   ![Select emails sent](../images/wpa/use/emails-sent.png)

3. Select edit (the pencil icon):

   ![Select pencil to edit](../images/wpa/use/emails-sent-edit-pencil.png)

4. Under **Emails sent where**, select **Add filter** and then select **Email**:

   ![Select email](../images/wpa/use/add-filter-email.png)

5. Next to **Email's**, select **Time of day**:

   ![Select time of day](../images/wpa/use/email-sent-time-of-day.png)

6. In the adjacent fields, select "<" (before) and specify 7:00 PM.

   ![Sent before 7:00 PM](../images/wpa/use/sent-before-7pm.png)

7. You have now filtered your base metric. You can optionally change the display name of this new filtered metric. In the field under **Display Name**, change **Emails sent** to **Emails sent before 7 PM** and then click outside the field to save the new name:

   ![Edit the metric name](../images/wpa/use/edit-metric-name.png)

   After you run the query, the edited metric name will appear as a header in the query results:

   ![Edited metric name](../images/wpa/use/edited-metric-name.png)
