# Notifications and What's new

The ribbon at the top of every page in Workplace Analytics offers several choices, including options to provide feedback; view information about your tenant, role, and session; and to view documentation. 

It also lets you view notifications and learn What's new in Workplace Analytics, as described in the following sections. 

## Notifications in Workplace Analytics

In the pages of Workplace Analytics, you can see notifications that provide you with timely information. These notifications cover data updates, product and feature updates, and updates related to your recent activity in Workplace Analytics. They also describe what has changed since you last used Workplace Analytics, plus timely updates and reminders of steps that you can take next in Workplace Analytics.

### Notification display is role based

The notifications that you see are based on the role that you've been assigned. If you have more than one role assigned, you can see notifications for all of your roles. 

### Notification types

Workplace Analytics notifications are of these types:

* **Warning** - Notification of scheduled service or downtime that will affect your ability to use Workplace Analytics.  
* **User** - You can take several actions in Workplace Analytics that generate notifications.  
* **System** - Notices that Office 365 or organizational data has been updated.
* **Knowledge** - Updates and links to playbooks and product updates.

### Reading and controlling notifications

The notifications panel is open by default on the Workplace Analytics Home page:

You can open this panel on any Workplace Analytics page by selecting the **Bell** icon in the ribbon. You can close the notifications panel by selecting the **Bell** icon again or simply by clicking outside the panel. After you have closed the panel, if you click the Home page or a notification link that causes the page to reload, the panel remains closed by default when the new page loads.

When a new notification arrives, a green circle with a number appears. This number displays the number of unread notifications. Notifications appear in the panel ten at a time. At the bottom of the panel, you have the option to load more notifications. Notifications are listed chronologically with the most recent at the top<!--, with one exception: A warning of planned system downtime appears at the very top. In this case, the notifications circle is red, not green-->.

After you hover over a notification, it is considered "dismissed" and the displayed number of unread notifications updates (if the panel is open). If you click a notification and trigger a new page to load or if you close the panel, the notifications are considered seen and dismissed, and the notification circle goes away. Selecting an external link open it in a new tab.

You cannot delete notifications, but notifications expire after 60 days.

### What's new with Workplace Analytics

To open the _What's new_ panel, select the bullhorn icon in the ribbon:

_What's new_ describes recently added features of Workplace Analytics, such as new dashboards, metrics, data sources, and navigation possibilities. 

It also describes upcoming features when the changes they bring will affect your current work. For example, if a new data source will change the way metrics are calculated, this section might encourage you to save current query results so that you can compare data from before the change with data after the change.  

### Use What's new 

Each _What's new_ item provides a short description of the feature. It also offers a **Read more** link. This link lets you drill deeper, either by opening the documentation for that feature or by presenting informative examples and a **Show me** link that takes you to the feature's page in Workplace Analytics.
