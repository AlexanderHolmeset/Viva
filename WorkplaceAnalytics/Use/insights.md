## Network graphs

Some of the insight visuals are organizational network analysis (ONA) graphs that help you visualize the collaborative relationships within your organization.

In these network graphs, each dot or node represents an employee or a group. The lines between the nodes represent connections, which are collaborative relationships between them. The node measures for employees are de-identified to maintain their privacy. Group node measures represent the group's measures, such as for a department (Sales) or a functional group (program managers) within the organization.

For details, see [Organizational network metrics](insight-ona-measures.md).
