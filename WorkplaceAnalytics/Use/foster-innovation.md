|Behavior |Percentage insight | Metrics |Calculations |
|---------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Foster cross-group collaboration |Percentage of organizations that effectively collaborate across groups and hierarchies  |Metrics |Calculation info |
|Enable deep work |Percentage of employees who have less than 10 hours for deep work each week |[Collaboration and focus hours](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics) |Calculation info |

|Behavior |Visual insight | Calculations|
|---------|--------|----------|------------|
|Foster cross-group collaboration |Collaboration across teams |An organizational network graph that shows the number of groups with high cross-group collaboration as compared to the other teams in your organization. Cross-group collaboration is based on the number of hours a group spent in meetings and on email with at least one person in another group. This uses time allocation logic. |
|Enable deep work |Distribution of time for deep work |Shows the percentage of employees who had uninterrupted time for deep work grouped by the amount of focus hours they had for the week. It uses [collaboration and focus hours](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics) to calculate this data. |
|Utilize influencers |Organizations with limited influencers |Shows the percentage of teams in your organization that are low on influencers. This graph uses the [influence](metric-definitions.md#organizational-network-analysis-ona-metrics) metric. |

## Best practices to foster innovation 

### Foster cross-group collaboration

Collaboration across organizational boundaries enables the learning and idea formation required for innovation. [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) explains that work "occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."

Ways to create opportunities for cross-group collaboration:

* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) to build community and communicate, share information, and brainstorm about projects.
* Give teams an opportunity to join cross-functional teams to compete in an innovation challenge around a key business challenge.

For more best practices and how to create goals across teams or departments, see [Best practices for cross-group collaboration](../tutorials/gm-cgcollaboration.md).

## Enable deep work

Time without meetings, emails and chats provides employees with the opportunity to complete challenging work, think creatively and generate innovative ideas. [How to establish a meeting-free day each week](https://insights.office.com/time-management/how-to-establish-a-meeting-free-day-each-week/) explains the "goal is uninterrupted focus" time to work "on projects that require focus and high-level thinking..."

Ways to enable focus time:

* Create a new team norm to not send chats to team members who have scheduled focus time and use the focus status signal in Microsoft Teams.
* Ask your team to use the [MyAnalytics Focus plan](../myanalytics/use/focus-plan.md) to automatically book focus time, protect this time by silencing chats, and track weekly progress.

For more best practices and ways to establish a 'no meeting' period, see [Best practices for focus time](../tutorials/gm-focus.md).

## Utilize influencers

Influencers are people and groups within an organization who are well connected and can drive innovation by efficiently sharing information with others. The [Accelerate! How innovative companies can use a strategy network to capitalize on challenges](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/strategy-network-how-innovative-companies-capitalize/) article says to "move faster and further, you need to pull more people than ever before into the strategic change game, but in a way that is economically realistic."

Ways to leverage influencers:

* Communicate through influencers by using MyAnalytics network insights to cultivate influence and the [Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections.
* Move cross-functional team collaboration to Microsoft Teams and ask influencer groups to create [Channels in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive the conversations.

For more best practices and how to identify and utilize team influencers, see [Best practices for influencers](../tutorials/gm-influencer.md).
