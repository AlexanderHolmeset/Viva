## Optimize meeting hours

Long and large meetings are costly and often a waste of manager time. Shorter and smaller meetings provide the best conditions for effective decision-making.

### Why it matters

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed:

* "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work."
* "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."
* "64 percent said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking."
* "62 percent said meetings miss opportunities to bring the team closer together."

## Prevent burnout

Pressure to "always be on" and long hours can lead to burnout. The amount of time managers spend collaborating outside of business hours is an indicator of burnout risk.

### Why it matters

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/) and [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can't articles, employees need to unplug](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/):

* "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."
* "[87] percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year."
* "According to the recent study of 1,400 workers, nearly half of respondents said that thinking about work outside of work hours regularly has a negative impact on their work-life balance."

### Best practices

* Ask employees to use [MyAnalytics wellbeing data](../MyAnalytics/Use/wellbeing.md) about after-hours activity and encourage them to disconnect.
* Ask employees to use the [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Alternate the time of global meetings to become more inclusive and minimize after-hours collaboration.
* Remind employees that the organization's success is based on a marathon, not a sprint.
* Encourage team to take turns taking time off. This reinforces trust, collaboration, efficiency which can lead to better work satisfaction.
* Practice setting and keeping boundaries. Boundaries can result in better overall team outcomes.

### Change catalyst: Define and share working hours

Add your working hours to your [Outlook email signature](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-email-signature-from-a-template-5b02c5ed-1e85-4d2a-a098-9628fe3231d8) and encourage your team to do the same to help manage the expectations of others. The following is an email signature example:

```
Cora Thomas
Program Manager
Redmond, Washington
My working hours are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM PT
```

## Strengthen management pipeline

Potential leaders are often difficult to discover within an organization. Employees who are well-connected and play an important role in sharing information throughout the organization may be effective leaders.

## Foster connectivity

Managers who have diverse ties across an organization are typically considered more effective and help their employees build strong networks.

### Why it matters

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explains how important cross-group collaboration is in getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

### Best practices

* Create cross-team communities for people with similar interests to share ideas, knowledge, and resources. This can also be done using [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
* Enable and use the [Insights Outlook add-in](/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md) and [MyAnalytics Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add colleagues to your **Important people** list, receive suggestions to meet, reminders to respond to emails, and complete tasks for these contacts.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.
* Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. A culture of fear exists when employees do not feel safe to come forward with ideas, and those on the fringe may be less conﬁdent about contributing.
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

### Change catalyst: Create goals across teams or departments

Managers can coordinate and assign liaison roles to communicate across teams and with other departments to help avoid isolation and ensure information flow. Here are a few goals for customer satisfaction as an example:

* Identify a cross-team goal of improving customer satisfaction.
* Identify the groups that should be involved, such as Support, Services, and Engineering.
* Align on an initial project and a platform, such as a Teams channel, to quickly find and respond to customer incidents.
* Create a platform to share ideas, such as a Teams channel and a monthly check-in meeting

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

### Why it matters

According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/):

* "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."
* "The opportunity is huge for better-run organizations and a higher quality of life for workers."
* "Bad management is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $398 billion annually."

### Best practices

* Require that managers schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.
* Prepare and remain flexible on discussion points in 1:1s. 1:1s are best with structure but not too much to allow for co-creation. Agree on discussion points at the start and allocate adequate time to the most important topics.
* Lead by example. People are more engaged if they work for a manager who is working at least as much as they are.
* Evenly distribute work. Highly utilized employees often work longer hours than their peers, which can lead to disengagement.
* Maintain large internal networks across the company. Employees who have larger networks than their managers are more likely to view leadership unfavorably. (In order to qualify as a connection, an employee must interact with another person at least two times per month in an email or meeting with five or fewer participants.)

### Change catalyst: Develop a 1:1 conversation series

Managers can use the following meeting agenda outline a guide for creating a series of 1:1 meetings with their employees, remembering to keep questions open-ended to spark discussions.

* Meeting 1: Share some positive feedback with your employee.
* Meeting 2: Explore how your employee interacts with the rest of the team.
* Meeting 3: Understand what your employee likes and dislikes about the job.
* Meeting 4: Define their assigned tasks and help them set priorities.
* Meeting 5: Ask how your employee wants to grow in the future.
* Meeting 6: Create space for your employee to share candid feedback and set short-term growth goals.

## Empower employees

Cultivating autonomy and development are essential for employee engagement. Managers who empower employees to make decisions and tackle new challenges are more effective and reclaim time.

### Why it matters

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed:

* "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work."
* "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."
* "64 percent said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking."
* "62 percent said meetings miss opportunities to bring the team closer together."

### Best practices

* Ask employees to use [Microsoft Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes for decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable [Manager insights in Workplace Analytics](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help managers identify ways to improve team behavior.
* Regularly and openly check in with employees. Frustration, resentment, and even hopelessness are signals that people are falling back into less productive patterns. Changing protocols and behaviors takes time, and sustaining momentum requires consistent attention.
* Assess and discuss progress around meeting habits and its impact on focus. Small, tangible wins provide something for people to celebrate, and small losses provide opportunities for learning and correction.
* [Share 6 tips for handling scheduling conflicts](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business-insights-ideas/resources/6-tips-handling-scheduling-conflicts).

### Change catalyst: Set team meeting rules and policy

* Take an employee survey to gather data and impressions about the organization's meeting frequency and its impact on how much work is or isn't getting done during the day.
* Come together as a team to share everyone's feedback. It's important to process all contributions and analysis from all team members to begin the process of change.
* Agree on a collective, personal goal based on the survey feedback. For example, declare "meeting free" periods to free up time on everyone's calendar. This increases individual focus time and productivity and reduces the spillover into personal time.
* Set standards for when an employee can decline a meeting. Provide a meeting decline template with policy explanations that employees can use to decline meetings based on your team’s meeting rules. For example, "the meeting has no agenda" or "someone from my team is already attending the meeting."
* Create and share your team’s list of meeting rules along with an empowering message that allows employees to say yes or no to meeting invitations they deem valuable or not to attend.
