## Optimize meeting hours

Long and large meetings are costly and often a waste of manager time. Shorter and smaller meetings provide the best conditions for effective decision-making.

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."

Ways to optimize meetings:

* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes. Employees can share meeting notes with decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable [Manager insights in Workplace Analytics](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help managers identify ways to support team behavior.

For more best practices and how to set team meeting rules and policy, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

## Prevent burnout

Pressure to "always be on" and long hours can lead to burnout. The amount of time managers spend collaborating outside of business hours is an indicator of burnout risk.

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/): "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."

Ways to support wellbeing:

* Use [MyAnalytics wellbeing data](../MyAnalytics/Use/wellbeing.md) about after-hours activity and encourage them to disconnect.
* Use the [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.

For more best practices and how to define and share working hours, see [Best practices for wellbeing](../tutorials/gm-wellbeing.md).

## Strengthen management pipeline

Potential leaders are often difficult to discover within an organization. Employees who are well-connected and play an important role in sharing information throughout the organization may be effective leaders.

## Foster connectivity

Managers who have diverse ties across an organization are typically considered more effective and help their employees build strong networks.

### Why it matters

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explains how important cross-group collaboration is in getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

### Best practices

* Create cross-team communities for people with similar interests to share ideas, knowledge, and resources. This can also be done using [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
* Enable and use the [Insights Outlook add-in](/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md) and [MyAnalytics Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add colleagues to your **Important people** list, receive suggestions to meet, reminders to respond to emails, and complete tasks for these contacts.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.
* Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. A culture of fear exists when employees do not feel safe to come forward with ideas, and those on the fringe may be less conﬁdent about contributing.
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

### Change catalyst: Create goals across teams or departments

Managers can coordinate and assign liaison roles to communicate across teams and with other departments to help avoid isolation and ensure information flow. Here are a few goals for customer satisfaction as an example:

* Identify a cross-team goal of improving customer satisfaction.
* Identify the groups that should be involved, such as Support, Services, and Engineering.
* Align on an initial project and a platform, such as a Teams channel, to quickly find and respond to customer incidents.
* Create a platform to share ideas, such as a Teams channel and a monthly check-in meeting

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition. According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/): "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."

One of the top best practices for promoting coaching and development is to require that managers schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.

For more best practices and how to develop a 1:1 conversation series, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

## Empower employees

Cultivating autonomy and development are essential for employee engagement. Managers who empower employees to make decisions and tackle new challenges are more effective and reclaim time.

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed, including "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work" and "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."

Ways to empower employees:

* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes. Employees can share meeting notes with decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable [Manager insights in Workplace Analytics](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help managers identify ways to support team behavior.
