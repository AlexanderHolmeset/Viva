# Data sources

>[!Note]
>You must be assigned either the administrator or the analyst role to access the **Data sources** page. For more information, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).

**Data sources** contains high-level views for Workplace Analytics administrators and data analysts to confirm that your Office 365 and organizational data is loaded and ready to use. And when you upload and process CRM data in Workplace Analytics, you'll also see a page for your CRM data.

  - [Office 365 data](#office-365-data)
  - [Organizational data](#organizational-data)
  - [CRM data](#crm-data) (only when you upload and process CRM data in Workplace Analytics)

## Office 365 data

As an admin or an analyst, you can use this page to confirm that your Office 365 data is up-to-date. Use this page to look for date ranges that have unexpected gaps in activity, inconsistent or degraded data, or activity levels that are higher or lower than what might be considered normal for your organization.

This page includes the following types of data.

* **Measured employees**: The employees to whom your Workplace Analytics administrator assigned licenses during setup. After license assignments, Workplace Analytics extracts Office 365 data about meetings, email, unscheduled calls, and instant messages for these people. When the data extraction process is successful for these employees, they are included in your measured population. If extraction errors occur and Workplace Analytics didn't get data for a person, that person is licensed but not counted as a measured employee in Workplace Analytics. If you are an analyst or limited analyst, this is the population that you can analyze within Workplace Analytics. The number of measured employees can help determine whether you have good data coverage for analysis.

  >[!Note]
  > Your admin can assign employees Workplace Analytics licenses as a group with Azure Active Directory (AAD). If this number seems inaccurate, confirm with your admin that only active employees are assigned licenses through AAD. For more details, see [Assign licenses](../setup/assign-licenses-to-population.md).

* **Internal collaborators**: These are unmeasured employees who were included in extractions of Office 365 data with whom the _measured_ employees collaborated. These people are not part of your measured population but are internal to your organization. Internal collaborators can include employees from other groups, vendors, or contractors that are working with your team and are included in the same internal domain as your team, but are not in your measured population.

* **External collaborators**: These are people outside of your company or external to your email domain with whom your measured employees collaborated. For more information about external collaboration, see [External collaboration](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md).

* **Average weekly collaboration chart**: This chart shows the last refreshed on weekly collaboration hours for measured employees by type, which can include hours spent on email, in meetings, in unscheduled calls, and on instant messages. The Last refreshed date shows when Office 365 Exchange and Teams data was most recently processed for this chart.

Hover your cursor over the chart data to get more details and use the chart legend to change what data (meetings, email, instant messages, and calls) the chart shows.

  ![Office 365 data sources page](../images/wpa/use/measured-collab.png)
<!--
  >[!Note]
  > If collaboration activity for Teams drops below 30 percent of the total collaboration, the unscheduled calls and instant message data will not show due to insufficient data.
-->

### Origin of data counts

The **Data sources > Office 365 data** page shows the current count of three categories of data. Most of this data originates with people in your organization, people who might or might not have Workplace Analytics licenses. But some data originates outside of your organization, and still other data comes from mailboxes of other types. 

Determining the origins of data also determines how to categorize it, as shown in the following flow chart: 

  ![Origin of data counts](../images/wpa/use/data-sources-final.png)

The following screenshot shows where each of these numbers appears on the **Office 365 data** page: 

  ![Office 365 data sources page](../images/wpa/use/data-sources-relate.png)

### Possible causes of inconsistent data

The following are examples of where you might encounter instances of inconsistency in the volume of email, meetings, calls, and instant messages data.

* **Major holidays**: Drops in email and meeting activity around major holidays is typical and can potentially impact analysis. You can remove these weeks from your outputs to reduce its impact.

* **Email archive policies**: Business policies can impact historical data processed during initial setup. As you view historical data, if you see a steady decline or point-in-time drop-off in email and/or meeting activity, it might be due to archiving. By using the Average weekly collaboration chart (see the preceding illustration), you can select a date range to analyze your collaboration data where the mail volume is stable.

* **Recurring meetings**: When a recurring meeting series is removed from a calendar, all past instances of this meeting are removed. As you view historical data, if you see a steady decline in meeting activity, it might be due to recurring meetings having been removed from calendars. By using the Average weekly collaboration chart (see the preceding illustration), you  can select a date range to analyze your collaboration data where the meeting volume is stable.

## Organizational data

Organizational data is information about employees that your company provides to Workplace Analytics through [uploads](../setup/upload-organizational-data.md) of organizational (HR) data.

As either an admin or an analyst, you can use this page to understand the data quality and completeness for employees who have an entry in the HR data file and are detected in the specified week's refresh of Office 365 data.

![Organizational data sources page](../images/wpa/Use/org-data-sources.png)

This page includes the following.

* **Page settings** (Settings and filters): Use the Page settings panel to the right of the page to change the **Group by** increments of time (day, week, or month) and what employees to include (all employees, internal collaborators, or measured employees) in the data shown. You can also use the Page setting **Filters** to filter the employee data shown on this page by a specific attribute, such as to only show employees in the sales or development groups.
* **Attributes**: These are all the attributes provided by your organization in the organizational or HR data upload file. When you [create queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md), you can filter and group employees in the organization by these attributes, so being familiar with them will give you insight into the types of queries to use for analysis.
* **Employees with attribute**: The number of measured employees and internal collaborators with a non-blank value for the attribute.
* **Coverage**: The percentage of measured employees who have a non-blank value for the specified attribute. If coverage levels are low, it'll be difficult to determine how people collaborate across different characteristics. Additionally, low coverage on required attributes may give skewed (under-reported) metric calculations for metrics that rely on those attributes.
* **Unique values**: The count of the unique attribute values included in the data. For example, if the **Region** attribute contains **North**, **South**, **Central**, **East**, **West** and **Southwest**, itâ€™s unique values count is six.

>[!Note]
> You can select a column name to sort the list by it in descending or ascending order. You can also type a keyword in the **Search** field to narrow the list to all attributes that contain that keyword.

### Attribute details

 To view a list of the top 500 values for an attribute and other details about it, select the attribute's name in the list. For example, the following graphic shows the top values and details for **Region**.

![View Organizational data attributes for Region](../images/wpa/Use/org-data-attributes.png)

This page includes the following.

* **Page settings** (Settings and filters): Use the Page settings panel to the right of the page to change the **Group by** increments of time (day, week, or month), the date range, and what employees to include (all employees, internal collaborators, or measured employees) in the data shown. You can also use the Page setting **Filters** to filter the employee data shown on this page by a specific attribute, such as to only show employees in the sales or development groups.
* **Coverage for**: This chart shows the coverage for the selected attribute at different moments in time. This historical data gives you insight into how the data for this attribute has changed over time and what date ranges will be useful for analysis. Select a bar in the chart to see the details for that date in the table.
* **Values**: Lists all values that exist for the selected attribute that were included in the uploaded organizational data for the selected date. When you [create queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md), you can filter and group accounts with a few of these attributes, so being familiar with these gives you insight into what types of queries will be useful for analysis.
* **Employees with this value**: This shows the number of people that have that attribute value in the data. For example, the following graphic shows the number of contacts that have a non-blank value for the selected attribute.
* **Coverage**: Shows the percentage of employees with that value.

>[!Note]
> Next to **Attribute details**, you can select a different attribute to change the focus of the details to it. Also, only the first 500 values are shown in this page's table. If the selected attribute has more than 500 values, you can select **Download CSV** to view the complete list of attribute values and details for those with more than 500 values in the downloaded .csv file.

For more information about what data is needed for metric calculations, see:

* [Prepare organizational data](../setup/Prepare-organizational-data.md)

* [Metric definitions](../Use/Metric-definitions.md)

## CRM data

This page gives you a high-level view of the latest available CRM data that you uploaded and was successfully processed in Workplace Analytics. It includes the number of accounts, contacts, and seller assignments that are available for data analysis.

By combining this data in Workplace Analytics, you can now analyze how sales activities connect to organizational outcomes. For example, you could analyze if the time your sales team spent with various accounts is proportionate to the revenue potential of those accounts, or if your top tier accounts are getting enough attention from your sales team.

### Join coverage

The **Join coverage** section describes the percent overlap between the uploaded list of accounts and the other uploaded lists of important CRM data, such as contacts and seller assignments, as shown in the following graphic. The higher the percentage overlap the more accurate analysis you can accomplish.

![CRM data sources page](../images/wpa/Use/crm-sources.png)

### External collaborators

You can also see the total number of external collaborators and related join coverage data, as shown in the following graphic.

![CRM external collaborators](../images/wpa/Use/crm-external-collab.png)

* **External collaborators** are people who have:

  * Work (non-personal) email addresses with domains outside (not members) of your organization.
  * Interacted with your organization's employees through email, meetings, calls, and instant messages.

* The **How external collaborators are matched with accounts** chart shows the external collaborators divided into the following groups based on their CRM account associations.

  1. Those who are matched through the CRM upload and default with CRM contacts.
  2. Those who are matched with accounts through the extrapolation option.
  3. Those who are not associated (unmatched) with any CRM account through upload or extrapolation.

* **Accounts and external collaborators** shows the percentage of the sum of the first two groups in visualization 2. Namely, external collaborators found by default (CRM upload) as well as external collaborators found through extrapolation. The bar under this metric reflects the percentage in terms of the total number of external collaborators.

### Join coverage notices

For join coverage based on the latest data uploads, you might see one of the following important notices, as shown in the following graphic.

* **Data is not associated**: This occurs when one or more attributes cannot be associated between the two sets of data for join coverage. You can select to download a .csv file and view the contacts or sellers that can't be associated with the corresponding accounts in the accounts table.
* **Data has not been processed**: This occurs when an upload hasn't been done yet, the data is currently being processed, or something failed during the validation or data processing phase. You can select the link to the Upload page and view the status of the upload, correct any issues, or upload new data. You can also ignore this warning if you don't plan to upload that specific data file.

![CRM join notices](../images/wpa/Use/crm-join-notices.png)

### Join coverage details

You can select one of the data titles, such as accounts or contacts, to view a list of attributes for it. For example, the following shows a list of attributes for contacts.

![View CRM attributes for contacts](../images/wpa/Use/crm-contact-attributes.png)

Similar to the Organizational data page, the CRM data attributes list includes the following.

* **Data upload date**: Shows when the data was last uploaded and processed, which is at the top of the list.
* **Attribute**: Lists the attributes provided in the uploaded data. When you [create queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md), you can filter and group accounts with a few of these attributes, so being familiar with these helps give insight into the types of queries you might want to create for analysis.
* **Employees with this attribute**: Depending on what data you're looking at, this shows the number of people that have that attribute in that data file. For example, the following graphic shows the number of contacts that have a non-blank value for that attribute.
* **Coverage**: Shows the percentage of attributes that have non-blank values. For example, in following graphic, 87.5% or 7 out of 8 accounts have non-blank values for the **AccountAnnualRevenue** attribute.
* **Unique values**: The count of the unique attribute values included in the data.

![View CRM attributes for accounts](../images/wpa/Use/crm-account-attributes.png)

>[!Note]
> You can select a column name to sort the list by it in descending or ascending order.

To view a list of the top 100 values for an attribute, select the attribute's name from the list. For example, the following graphic shows the top values for **AccountId** in an accounts data file.

* To view the list for a different attribute, select it from the list at the top of the table.
* You can select a column title to sort the list by that column in descending or ascending order.
* Type a keyword in the **Search** field to search all attributes that include that keyword, such as email or phone.

### Account collaboration coverage

In the **Accounts and external collaborators** section of the CRM data sources page, you can select **View details** to see a more detailed view of account collaboration as shown in the following graphic.

![View CRM account collaboration coverage](../images/wpa/Use/crm-account-collab.png)

The **Account details** page includes the following.

* The **Number of collaborators matched** chart shows the number of external collaborators matched with accounts by default and by default plus extrapolation, which correspond to the Account collaboration coverage chart.

  * **Default match with CRM data** is based on the imported data from the CRM upload to match up email addresses for Office 365 external collaborators with email addresses for CRM contacts.
  * **Default + Extrapolation match with CRM data** includes the same default email comparison data and for any *unmatched external collaborators*, it then calculates the probability of which CRM account they most likely match up with. If the probability that an external collaborator belongs to a specific CRM account is high, the external collaborator is assigned to that account. This option provides more coverage for external collaborators and for capturing more customer interactions.
* The **Collaboration time** chart shows the number of collaboration hours that employees invested with external collaborators in each of the â€˜matched by defaultâ€™ and â€˜matched by default + extrapolationâ€™ groups. The collaboration time is based on interactions through email, meeting, calls, and instant messages.
* The **Account collaboration by domain** table lists collaborator domains and the following related  account details:

  * **Account name** is the name of the account in the CRM upload.
  * **Number of collaborators matched by default** is the number of external collaborators within Workplace Analytics who match up with the CRM contact email addresses associated with that CRM account.
  * **Number of collaborators matched by extrapolation + default** is the number of external collaborators who have a high probability of belonging to this account, in addition to the external collaborators matched to this account by default.
  * **Default collaboration hours** is the number of collaboration hours that employees invested with external collaborators in the â€˜matched by defaultâ€™ group.
  * **Extrapolation + default collaboration hours** is the number of collaboration hours that employees invested with external collaborators in both the â€˜matched by defaultâ€™ and â€˜matched by extrapolationâ€™ groups.

#### Download data set

The **Account collaboration by domain** table can list up to a maximum of 500 CRM accounts. To view the complete data set for accounts larger than 500, you can view all the accounts in the downloaded .csv file. You have the following options when you download the accounts data set: 

  ![CRM account collaboration details download](../images/wpa/Use/crm-download.png)

* The **Accounts** option organizes the records by the AccountName attribute. The following is an example of account output for this option:

  |AccountId |AccountName |TotalCollaboratorCount| TotalCollaborationHours |DefaultCollaborationHours | DefaultCollaboratorCount |
  |-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|
  |a60e4ac7 |Contoso |10,000 |122,005 |85 |6,340 |
  |49a80cfe |Anon 23,000 |1660,40 |102 |8,609
  |13bcc1ab |Acme.com |4,000 |22,010 |70 |5,843 |

  The attributes included in the download options:
  
  * **AccountId** is the unique account identifier.
  * **AccountName** is the account name  that's listed in the CRM upload Account table.
  * **TotalCollaboratorCount** is the number of external collaborators who have a high probability of belonging to this account, in addition to the external collaborators matched to this account by default.
  * **TotalCollaborationHours** is the collaboration time your employees invested with the total set of external collaborators (Total Collaborators) associated with this account. This â€˜timeâ€™ is derived from interactions such as emails, meetings.
  * **DefaultCollaboratorCount** is the number of external collaborators within WpA which match against CRM contact email addresses associated with this account.
  * **DefaultCollaborationHours** is the collaboration time your employees invested with the default set of external collaborators (Default Collaborators) associated with this account. This â€˜timeâ€™ is derived from interactions, such as email, meetings, calls, and instant messages.

* **Accounts and account collaboration by domain** gives the same details as the Accounts option, however this option organizes the records by the email domains of the contacts associated with the accounts. The additional attribute included in this download option is **Domain**, which is the domain email address for each account listed.

* **Accounts and External Collaborator email addresses** organizes the records by the contact email addresses and lists all external collaborator email addresses and related attributes. The following is an example of account output for this option:

  |AccountId |AccountName |Domain |EmailAddress
  |-----|-----|-----|-----|
  |a60e4ac7 |Contoso |CONTOSO.COM |salesteam@contoso.com |
  |49a80cfe |Anon |ANON.COM |bdmanager@anon.com |
  |13bcc1ab |Acme.com |ACME.COM |john.doe@acme.com |

  The additional attribute included in this download option is **Email Address**, which is the contactâ€™s email address for the account.
