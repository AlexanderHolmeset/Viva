## Best practices to enhance organizational resiliency

### Improve team cohesion

Changes in work environments can leave employees feeling isolated from their colleagues. Feeling part of community is important for engagement and goal alignment as employees navigate change.

<!-- Why it matters quote - check out Encourage team cohesion section in boost-engagement.md-->

Ways to improve team cohesion:

* In MyAnalytics, add colleagues to your [important people list](../../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights#add-important-people); also, receive suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from these contacts.
* Provide teams with virtual opportunities to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities such as online games.

For more best practices, see [Best practices for manager connectedness](../tutorials/gm-connectedness.md).

### Protect employee wellbeing

Rapid shifts in ways of working can blur the line between 'home' and 'work'. One indicator of burnout risk is the amount of time employees spend collaborating outside of standard business hours. 

<!-- Why it matters quote - check out Prevent employee burnout section in boost-engagement.md-->

Ways to protect employee wellbeing: 

* Provide managers with data on after-hours activity and the ability to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Together mode provides your team with a shared background on video meetings. It cuts down on video meeting fatigue by making them feel more like in-person.

For more best practices and ways to protect employees' after hours, see [Best practices for wellbeing](../tutorials/gm-wellbeing.md).

### Practice empathy

During periods of disruption, managers play a critical role in helping employees navigate change and preserve a sense of belonging. One-on-one (1:1) manager time measures how much time managers spend meeting individually with direct reports.

<!-- Why it matters quote - check out Promote coaching and development section in boost-engagement.md-->

Ways to practice empathy: 

* Use MyAnalytics to automatically schedule 1:1 time, receive reminders to do so, and follow up on tasks related to direct reports.
* Require managers to meet with direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal.

For more best practices and ways to establish better connections between managers and their teams, see [Best practices for focus time](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

### Free up capacity

Resilient organizations respond to changing demands and new opportunities by nimbly adapting and refocusing employees' time to align with new priorities.

<!-- Why it matters quote - check out Drive employee empowerment section in boost-engagement.md-->

Ways to free up capacity: 

* Channels in Microsoft Teams provide team members with a new way to get questions answered and provide updates without the need for a meeting.
* Encourage employees to politely say no to meetings that lack an agenda or are misaligned with priorities. The feedback will motivate organizers to plan more carefully.

For more best practices and ways to establish 'meeting-free' periods, see [Best practices for focus time](../tutorials/gm-focus.md).

### Accelerate decision-making

Rapidly changing conditions require swift decision-making. Managers with poor calendar management habits become obstacles to team goal attainment and create bottlenecks in decision-making.

<!-- Why it matters quote - check out Improving meeting quality section in effective-operations.md-->

Ways to accelerate decision-making: 

* MyAnalytics insights helps improve calendar management by increasing awareness of conflicting meetings and suggesting meetings to stay informed of decisions.
* Managers who decline meetings as soon as possible with a brief explanation for why they did so reinforce decision rights and model healthy habits.
