# Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams - My Organization

## Overview

Organizational insights for business leaders can be viewed on the My organization page of the Microsoft Viva Insights app. These insights give you a snapshot of how your company is doing by presenting company-wide outcomes to focus on and by showing leading indicators for each outcome, which help you see why it's important to pay attention to that outcome at the moment: 

![Outcomes page](../images/wpa/use/viva-org-outcomes.png)

While you can also see these outcomes and their related best practices in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them in Teams, the tool that you're already using for communicating during remote work, the tool you use for meeting, sharing files, and sending IMs to employees and other leaders. 

#### Personal insights are also available

In addition to information about your organization, the Viva Insights app also offers you two _personal insights_, insights that help any employee with their daily work and are not specifically intended for business leaders:

 * **Stay connected** – Viva Insights will help you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues through features such as AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. For more information about the Stay connected feature, see [Stay connected](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#stay-connected).  

 * **Protect time** – VIva Insights will help you find more time to eliminate distractions, stop multi-tasking, and focus on your core priorities. For more information about Protect time feature, see [Protect time](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#protect-time-tab).

## Use the My organization page

The My organization page in the Viva insights app shows the following outcomes:
 * Organizational resiliency
 * Employee engagement
 * Improve agility
 * Foster innovation
 * Effective managers
 * Operational effectiveness
 * Accelerate change
 * Transform meeting culture
 * Increase customer focus

![outcomes on the Outcomes page](../images/wpa/use/viva-org-outcomes.png)

To use the My organization page, view the outcomes and decide which might warrant action on your part. Look at the leading indicators; do you see any red flags? 

### Drill down to the insights level

To investigate further, drill down by selecting one of the outcomes to see the insights for that outcome. For example, select the **Effective managers** outcome to see the **Develop effective managers** insights:

![Develop effective managers](../images/wpa/use/dev-effect-managers.png)

Similarly, you can select **Boost employee engagement** on the Outcomes page to see the **Boost employee engagement** insights:

![Boost employee engagement](../images/wpa/use/viva-org-boost-engagement.png)

### Drill down to the best-practices level

To learn about taking action on an outcome, you can drill down another layer to see related best practices. For example, on the **Boost employee engagement** insight, select **View best practices**. This opens the panel called, **Best Practices: Increase frequency of coaching**:

![Best practice - Coaching frequency](../images/wpa/use/teams-bestprac-freq-coaching-70.png)

## Viva Insights and Workplace Analytics

The Viva Insights app shows you outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Workplace Analytics also shows outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Here's how the two apps compare: 

#### Similar functionality

* In both Viva Insights and in Workplace Analytics, you see outcomes on the initial page. You drill down by selecting an outcome to see its insights. You can drill down further by selecting an insight to see what best practices are recommended for it. 

#### Different functionality 

* In Workplace Analytics, the best practices pages offer additional action links that you can select, such as **Explore the stats**, **Explore in Power BI**, and **Plans**. 

For example, in Workplace Analytics, by selecting **Increase frequency of coaching** on the page of the **Boost employee engagement** outcome, you see the best practices for the **Increase frequency of coaching** insight:

![WpA best practice - increase frequency](../images/wpa/use/wpa-boost-best-prac-70.png)

Here is the same best practice in Viva Insights:

![Insights best practice - increase frequency](../images/wpa/use/teams-bestprac-freq-coaching-70.png)

You'll notice that the following section does not appear in the best practices page in Viva Insights: 

![in WpA but not in Viva Insights](../images/wpa/use/in-wpa-not-teams.png)

This section offers an **Explore the stats** link. To be able to explore these stats, you need to open this best practice in Workplace Analytics, not in Insights. 

### Feature descriptions

These outcomes, insights, and best practices are described in the Workplace Analytics documentation. As you browse this documentation, bear in mind the differences that are described in [Different functionality](#different-functionality).

 * [Boost employee engagement](boost-engagement.md)
