## Best practices to maximize operational effectiveness

### Free up capacity

Reducing the amount of time wasted on low-quality collaboration is a way to create capacity for activities that create business value.

As explained in [How to finally kill the useless, recurring meeting](https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-finally-kill-the-useless-recurring-meeting), it's not only that the meeting provides little value or that people are multitasking; it's that "the sheer amount of time invested in these low-value interactions is a high-cost impediment to getting things done."

Ways to help free up capacity:

* Provide managers with access to after-hours activity and the ability to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Use short meetings (such as only 15 minutes) with focused agendas. Such meetings are common in high-stakes workplaces to debrief or reflect on an event.

For more best practices and ways to schedule shorter meetings, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Improve meeting quality

Long and large meetings are costly and often considered a waste of time. Shorter meetings with fewer people can enhance individual and team performance.

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."

Ways to optimize meetings:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../myanalytics/use/mya-notifications.md#shorten-a-meeting) to shorten meetings. For example, when you're composing a meeting invitation with a duration of one hour, an inline suggestion will remind you to shorten the meeting by 15 minutes.
* Invite fewer people. When preparing the agenda, include the purpose of each participant's attendance. This exercise can reveal unnecessary invitees, including people who are optional or only require meeting notes.

For more best practices and ways to schedule shorter meetings, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Keep employees engaged

Email and chat activity during meetings unrelated to meeting goals can lead to different interpretations of decisions, missed guidance, and inconsistent follow-through on action items.

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."

Ways to keep employees engaged:

* Prepare thoughtful agendas that clearly state meeting goals and the purpose of each participant's attendance. Frame agenda topics as questions to focus and prime discussion.
* Use the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in to prepare for meetings. It provides insights about meeting information, related documents, and reminders to book preparation time.
* People have short attention spans. To keep meeting participants engaged during longer meetings, structure agendas in 15-minute increments and take mini-breaks.

For more best practices and ways to maintain the interest and participation of meeting attendees, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Protect time to get work done

Time without meetings, emails and chats provides employees with the opportunity to get important work done and think creatively.

Ways to protect time:

* The MyAnalytics Focus plan lets you automatically book focus time, protects this time by silencing chats, and allows you to track your progress weekly.
* Create a new team norm to respect the Microsoft Teams focus status of others by not send chats to teammates whose status displays as 'Focus'.
