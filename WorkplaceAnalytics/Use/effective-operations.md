### Improve meeting quality

Long and large meetings are costly and often considered a waste of time. Shorter meetings with fewer people can enhance individual and team performance.

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."

Ways to optimize meetings:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../myanalytics/use/mya-notifications.md#shorten-a-meeting) to shorten meetings. For example, when you're composing a meeting invitation with a duration of one hour, an inline suggestion will remind you to shorten the meeting by 15 minutes.
* Invite fewer people. When preparing the agenda, include the purpose of each participant's attendance. This exercise can reveal unnecessary invitees, including people who are optional or only require meeting notes.

For more best practices and ways to schedule shorter meetings, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).
