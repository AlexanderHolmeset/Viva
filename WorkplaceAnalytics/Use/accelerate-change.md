## Engage influencers

Leveraging the right teams and people to promote new technology can help drive adoption at scale. Well-connected people share information efficiently and are not always easy to identify.

Influencers are remarkably successful at driving cross-organizational initiatives and transformations. Ensuring influencer representation across the company can help navigate across hierarchical boundaries and accelerate the execution of growth-focused projects.

### Why it matters

The [Accelerate! How innovative companies can use a strategy network to capitalize on challenges](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/strategy-network-how-innovative-companies-capitalize/) article explains how companies need more volunteer change agents and that:

* "To move faster and further, you need to pull more people than ever before into the strategic change game, but in a way that is economically realistic."
* “Today companies must constantly seek competitive advantage without disrupting daily operations."
* "Strategy should be viewed as a dynamic force that constantly seeks opportunities, identifies initiatives that will capitalize on them, and completes those initiatives swiftly and efficiently."
* "The game is all about vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action, and celebration — not budget reviews, reporting relationships, and compensation."

### Best practices

* Communicate through influencers. Use MyAnalytics network insights to cultivate influence and the [Network](../myanalytics/use/network.md) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections.
* Move cross-functional team collaboration to Microsoft Teams and ask influencer groups to create [Channels in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive the conversations.
* Operate on a “dual operating system”, which is a management-driven hierarchy working with a strategy network.
* Recruit volunteers interested in being a part of the organization’s strategy network. Ten percent of the managerial and employee population is enough.
* A strategy network needs leadership, which focuses on vision, opportunity, agility, inspired action and celebration.
* The strategy network and the hierarchy must be inseparable, with a constant flow of information and activity between them, which is an approach that works in part because the volunteers in the network all work within the hierarchy.

### Change catalyst: Identify and utilize team influencers

Seek out influencers on your team and leverage their network and ability to share ideas, knowledge, and habits. The following are some ways to do so:

* Look for influencers, or employees who are highly networked.
* Create a small group of influencers to brainstorm what they consider to be the best practices for networking at your company.
* Identify projects that highlight the influencers and projects with opportunities for others to join.
* Communicate the role of influencers and the chosen projects to your whole team.
* Ask the influencers to share a similar message and to encourage their colleagues to connect with someone new.
* Continue the excitement and momentum with regular communications about successful outcomes.

## Measure Teams adoption

Successful digital transformations require a real-time understanding of technology adoption rates and usage trends within the organization.

### Why it matters

Based on the information presented in the article about [What email, IM, and the phone are each good for](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/what-email-im-and-the-phone-are-each-good-for/), you might be hampering productivity with too many emails:

* "We default to email to connect with people — to the tune of 122 business emails, on average, per person per day"
* “Your colleagues have plenty on their own to-do lists."
* "In order to get the response you need, when you need it, you must make it as easy as possible for the recipient to get back to you — and this is where choosing the right medium makes a difference.”

### Best practices

* Launch a [champions program](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-adoption-create-champions-program) for employees who are early adopters of Teams and can guide, teach, and train their peers.
* User [Power BI Teams insights](../tutorials/power-bi-teams.md) to monitor Teams usage through Workplace Analytics data, including instant messages, meeting, and email metrics.
* Share [Microsoft Teams free, live, online training classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/instructor-led-training-teams-landing-page) with employees to help get them up and running quickly with Teams.
* Consider the nature of the conversation based on the subject and type of response needed and identify the appropriate medium for communication.
* Encourage using instant messages for urgent questions to get what you need faster.
* When dealing with a sensitive topic, a quick chat on the phone or in person is more ideal than volleying emails back and forth.
* Schedule a more structured meeting or conference call when dealing with multiple people.
* Keep emails short and be sure the subject line is searchable.

### Change catalyst: Be a role model for Teams use

Your team is more likely to use Microsoft Teams if they are familiar with it and if they have coworkers that are already using it. Model the following behaviors with your team and encourage others to join you:

* Communicate the personal and team benefits of using Teams.
 Take a communication that you usually send by email and move it to Teams.
* If you receive an email from a siloed group, post it in your Teams channel and tag people that might benefit from the shared knowledge.
* Each week give a team member kudos for a job well done on your Teams channel.

## Support connectivity

Teams provides a shared work environment that strengthens connectivity and boosts productivity. Monitoring team cohesion post technology adoption is an indication of tool effectiveness.

### Why it matters

The [Rebuilding companies as communities](https://insights.office.com/culture/rebuilding-companies-as-communities/) and [How managers can make casual networking events more inclusive](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/how-managers-can-make-casual-networking-events-more-inclusive/) explain how important a community is for an organization and that:

* "Communityship requires a more modest form of leadership that might be called engaged and distributed management. A community leader is personally engaged in order to engage others, so that anyone and everyone can exercise initiative."
* “Most sustainable improvements in community occur when citizens discover their own power to act...when citizens stop waiting for professionals or elected leadership to do something and decide they can reclaim what they have delegated to others."
* "Organizations function best when committed people work in cooperative relationships based on respect."
* "Small groups are more effective than great leadership or individual training in creating strong communities."
* "Part of the solution is to invite people from underrepresented backgrounds to these kinds of events. The other solution is one that can create lasting change for diversity and inclusion: organize inclusive events that welcome employees from all backgrounds."
* "Offer activities that structure interactions without triggering social anxiety and are considerate of diverse personalities, languages, cultures, ethnicities, and physical abilities."

### Best practices

* Share the collection of [Microsoft Teams training videos](https://support.microsoft.com/office/overview-of-teams-and-channels-c3d63c10-77d5-4204-a566-53ddcf723b46?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams) that help employees best use Teams, including how to experience all of the features of Channels.
* Learn tips and tricks on LinkedIn Learning, such as the [weekly Teams Tips video](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/microsoft-teams-tips-weekly/learn-tips-for-mastering-microsoft-teams?u=3322), to help employees master Teams and stay current on the latest Teams features and improvements.

### Change catalyst: Host informal gatherings using Teams Video Calls

Provide your employees with virtual opportunities to bond over non-work activities and form connections through Teams meetings. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities such as online games.

* Create open cafeteria meetings during the lunch hour for people to jump in.
* Create virtual hallway conversation and utilize breakout rooms to foster small group conversation.
* Encourage leaders to occasionally join these conversations further incentivizing people to join.
