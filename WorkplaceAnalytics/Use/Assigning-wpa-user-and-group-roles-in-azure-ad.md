# Assign Workplace Analytics user and group roles in Azure Active Directory

To add Workplace Analytics user roles in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

1. Sign in to your tenant's [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com).

2. In the left navigation menu, select **Enterprise Applications**.

8. Under **Add Assignment**, select **Users and groups**.

9. In the search field under Users and Groups, type the name of the user to assign the required permissions and then press **Enter**. The user name will appear under the search field.

10. Select the name and then select the blue **Select** button.

      ![Select user.](../images/WpA/Use/select-user-5.png)

    **Users and groups** shows that the new user is selected.

11. Under **Add Assignment**, select **Select Role** to choose the role you want to assign the selected user.

      ![Select a role.](../images/WpA/Use/select-role-7.png)

12. From the list that appears, select one of the following roles:

    * Analyst
    * Analyst (Limited Access)
    * Administrator
    * Program manager

    ![Select role.](../images/WpA/Use/select-role-8.png)

13. Select the **Select** button.

14. Select the **Assign** button.

     ![Assign role.](../images/WpA/Use/assign-role-9.png)

    Users and groups now displays the user's new assigned Workplace Analytics role.

15. (Optional) Add additional roles: 
 * To add another role to the _same_ user, repeat steps 11-14.    
 * To add roles to _other_ users, repeat steps 7-14. 

Allow time for the changes to be saved in the system. The user can now sign in to [Workplace Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com) with their new role and its corresponding access permissions.

## Assign roles to groups

You can also assign roles to groups, which means that you are assigning the access permissions associated with that role to the group. Any users who are assigned to that group then automatically become members of the group and receive the same permissions that are assigned to that role.

To assign users and roles to Workplace Analytics groups, the steps are similar to those for assigning users, as previously described in steps 9 through 14. In that same process, where you add the name of a user in step 9, at the same time, you can also add a group and assign it a role. The only difference is that instead of a user name, you substitute the name of your group, then select the group and assign a role to it.

If you have not yet created a Workplace Analytics group in Azure AD, and want to do so, see the article on creating a group in **Related topics**.

## FAQ

**When would you assign a role to a group rather than to an individual user?**

It depends on the situation or on your company's policy, but generally speaking, the reason for choosing between one method and another is usually efficiency. In a smaller company, if a few people will be assigned Workplace Analytics roles, it can be convenient to assign user roles individually, especially if such roles are unlikely to change.

However, in a larger company where the number of users required for the same role is significant, for example, Program Managers, it is more efficient to assign a role to a group, and then add users to the group, because groups are easier to manage and audit.
