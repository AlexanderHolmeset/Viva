# Boost employee engagement

Employees with high job satisfaction and a strong sense of belonging are more likely to produce high-quality work, identify business opportunities, and remain at the organization.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

Each of the following behaviors show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data.

## Visual insights

The following defines the organizational data shown in the visual behavioral insights.

|Behavior |Visual insight | Definition |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
|Promote coaching and development |Distribution 1:1 time with managers each month |Percentage of employees based on their monthly meeting hours with managers 1:1. They are divided into employees who have no 1:1s, between zero and one hour, and more than one hour of 1:1s with their manager in a month. These percentages are calculated monthly and averaged over the entire time period. This graph uses the [meeting hours with manager 1:1](metric-definitions.md#meeting-hours-with-manager-1-1-define) metric.|
|Prevent employee burnout | Distribution of weekly after-hours collaboration |Percentage of employees based on their weekly [after-hours collaboration](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics). They are divided into employees who spend less than one hour collaborating after-hours, employees who spend between 1 to 5 hours collaborating after-hours, and employees who spend more than 5 hours collaborating after-hours. These percentages are calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Drive employee empowerment |Distributions of manager employee coaching relationships |Uses the average time employees spent with [their managers in 1:1s](metric-definitions.md#meeting-hours-with-manager-1-1-define) and the percentage of [meeting hours with manager in attendance](metric-definitions.md#meeting-hours-with-manager-define), the different employee-manager coaching relationships are grouped by employee time percentages: <ul><li>**Coached** - Spent more than 15 minutes in 1:1s (weekly average based on the monthly calculation) and those who spent less than 30 percent of their meeting hours with their managers in attendance.  </li><li>**Co-attended** - Spent less than 15 minutes in 1:1s (weekly average based on the monthly calculation) and those who spent more than 30 percent of their meeting hours with their managers in attendance. </li><li>**Micromanaged** - Spent more than 15 minutes in 1:1s (weekly average based on the monthly calculation) and those who spent more than 30 percent of their meeting hours with their managers in attendance. </li><li>**Under-coached** - Spent less than 15 minutes in 1:1s (weekly average based on the monthly calculation) and employees who have less than 30 percent of their meeting hours with their managers in attendance.</li> |<!--|Encourage team cohesion |Cohesion within teams |An [organizational network graph](insight-ona-measures.md) that shows the number of teams with strong cohesion and those who are not very cohesive based on the average monthly collaboration activity within the team’s network.

## Best practices to boost employee engagement

### Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition. According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/): "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."

One of the top best practices for promoting coaching and development is to require that managers schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.

For more best practices and how to develop a 1:1 conversation series, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

### Prevent employee burnout

Pressure to "always be on" and long hours can lead to employee burnout. The amount of time employees spend collaborating outside of business hours is an indicator of burnout risk.

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/): "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."

Ways to support employee wellbeing:

* Ask employees to use [MyAnalytics wellbeing data](../MyAnalytics/Use/wellbeing.md) about after-hours activity and encourage them to disconnect.
* Ask employees to use the [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.

For more best practices and how to define and share working hours, see [Best practices for wellbeing](../tutorials/gm-wellbeing.md).
<!--
### Encourage team cohesion

Employees who maintain strong connections within their team feel a sense of organizational belonging.

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural "brokers" to "promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."

Ways to support team cohesion:

* Ask employees to use [MyAnalytics network features](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add people to their "important people" list, which enables suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from them.
* Host informal gatherings, such as virtual opportunities for your team to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities, such as online trivia games.
* Strengthen connections with a [Teams channel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for group communications and chats.

For more best practices and how to open your network to your teams, see [Best practices for manager connectedness](../tutorials/gm-connectedness.md).-->

### Drive employee empowerment

Cultivating autonomy and development are essential for employee engagement. Managers who empower employees to make decisions and tackle new challenges are more effective and reclaim time.

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed, including "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work" and "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."

Ways to empower employees:

* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes. Employees can share meeting notes with decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable [Manager insights in Workplace Analytics](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help managers identify ways to support team behavior.

For more best practices and how to set team meeting rules and policy, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).
