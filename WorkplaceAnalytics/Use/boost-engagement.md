# Boost employee engagement

How is work-life integration affecting employee engagement? Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover.

These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your organization is working after hours on email or instant messages.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.
