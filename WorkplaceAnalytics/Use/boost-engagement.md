# Boost employee engagement

Employees with high job satisfaction and a strong sense of belonging are more likely to produce high-quality work, identify business opportunities and remain at the organization.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

Each of the following behaviors show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data. You can select Take action to see ways you can drive change or simply maintain employee engagement.

## Drive employee empowerment

Cultivating autonomy and development are essential for employee engagement. Managers who empower employees to make decisions and tackle new challenges are more effective and reclaim time.

### Why it matters

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed:

* "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work."
* "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."
* "64 percent said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking."
* "62 percent said meetings miss opportunities to bring the team closer together."

### Best practices

* Say no to meetings. See the next section for a guide on how to create and share a set of team meeting rules and policy.
* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes. Employees can share meeting notes with decisions and action items with managers as an alternative way to keep them informed.
* Enable manager insights in Workplace Analytics to see your team’s current behaviors and ways to help them improve.
* Regularly and openly check in with employees. Frustration, resentment, and even hopelessness are signals that people are falling back into less productive patterns. Changing protocols and behaviors takes time, and sustaining momentum requires consistent attention.
* Assess and discuss progress around meeting habits and its impact on focus. Small, tangible wins provide something for people to celebrate, and small losses provide opportunities for learning and correction.

### Change catalyst: Set team meeting rules and policy

* Take an employee survey to gather data and impressions about the organization's meeting frequency and its impact on how much work is or isn't getting done during the day.
* Come together as a team to share everyone's feedback. It's important to process all contributions and analysis from all team members to begin the process of change.
* Agree on a collective, personal goal based on the survey feedback. For example, declare "meeting free" periods to free up time on everyone's calendar. This increases individual focus time and productivity and reduces the spillover into personal time.
* Set standards for when an employee can decline a meeting. Provide a meeting decline template with policy explanations that employees can use to decline meetings based on your team’s meeting rules. For example, "the meeting has no agenda" or "someone from my team is already attending the meeting."
* Create and share your team’s list of meeting rules along with an empowering message that allows employees to say yes or no to meeting invitations they deem valuable or not to attend.

## Encourage team cohesion

Employees who maintain strong connections within their team feel a sense of organizational belonging.

### Why it matters

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural brokers:

* "Cultural brokers promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."
* “The value of horizontal collaboration is widely recognized."
* "Employees who can reach outside their silos to find colleagues with complementary expertise learn more, sell more, and gain skills faster.”

### Best practices

* Use [MyAnalytics network features](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to add people to your "important people" list, which enables suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from them.
* Host informal gatherings, such as virtual opportunities for your team to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities, such as online trivia games.
* Strengthen connections with a [Teams channel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for group communications and chats.
* Encourage and train workers to ask the right questions. Minimize preconceptions by asking open-ended questions.
* Get people to see things through others’ eyes by organizing carefully structured, face-to-face, cross-silo dialogues.
* Urge employees to explore distant networks. Employees need to be pushed to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.
* Identify employees with strong interpersonal skills and a growth mindset to build relationships and collaborate across different functions and geographies.

### Change catalyst: Open your network to your teams

If you have a large network, you can help broaden your team's networks as well. Start by reviewing your key contacts and identifying connections that match the interests and skills of your team members. The following can help you get started:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../MyAnalytics/Use/network.md), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and your contacts list to review your network.
* Categorize topics of expertise for those in your network.
* Review the career goals and skills of those on your team.
* Create a contact list and store it in a central location to access when onboarding new team members.
* Make introductions between relevant contacts and your team members.

## Prevent employee burnout

Pressure to "always be on" and long hours can lead to employee burnout. The amount of time employees spend collaborating outside of business hours is an indicator of burnout risk.

### Why it matters

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/) and [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can't articles, employees need to unplug](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/):

* "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."
* "[87] percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year."
* "According to the recent study of 1,400 workers, nearly half of respondents said that thinking about work outside of work hours regularly has a negative impact on their work-life balance."

### Best practices

* Ask employees to use [MyAnalytics wellbeing data](../MyAnalytics/Use/wellbeing.md) about after-hours activity and encourage them to disconnect.
* Ask employees to use the [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Alternate the time of global meetings to become more inclusive and minimize after-hours collaboration.
* Remind employees that the organization's success is based on a marathon, not a sprint.
* Encourage team to take turns taking time off. This reinforces trust, collaboration, efficiency which can lead to better work satisfaction.
* Practice setting and keeping boundaries. Boundaries can result in better overall team outcomes.

### Change catalyst: Define and share working hours

Add your working hours to your [Outlook email signature](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-email-signature-from-a-template-5b02c5ed-1e85-4d2a-a098-9628fe3231d8) and encourage your team to do the same to help manage the expectations of others. The following is an email signature example:

```
Cora Thomas
Program Manager
Redmond, Washington
My working hours are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM PT
```

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

### Why it matters

According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/):

* "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."
* "The opportunity is huge for better-run organizations and a higher quality of life for workers."
* "Bad management is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $398 billion annually."

### Best practices

* **Schedule recurring 1:1 meetings** - Require managers to meet with direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.
* **Prepare and remain flexible on discussion points for 1:1s** - 1:1s are best with structure but not too much to allow for co-creation. Agree on discussion points at the start and allocate adequate time to the most important topics.
* **Lead by example** - People are more engaged if they work for a manager who is working at least as much as they are.
* **Evenly distribute work** - Highly utilized employees often work longer hours than their peers, which can lead to disengagement.
* **Maintain large internal networks across the company** - Employees with larger networks than their manager are more likely to view leadership unfavorably. (In order to qualify as a connection, an employee must interact with another person at least two times per month in an email or meeting with five or fewer participants.)

### Change catalyst: Develop a 1:1 conversation series

Managers can use the following meeting agenda outline a guide for creating a series of 1:1 meetings with their employees, remembering to keep questions open-ended to spark discussions.

* Meeting 1: Share some positive feedback with your employee.
* Meeting 2: Explore how your employee interacts with the rest of the team.
* Meeting 3: Understand what your employee likes and dislikes about the job.
* Meeting 4: Define their assigned tasks and help them set priorities.
* Meeting 5: Ask how your employee wants to grow in the future.
* Meeting 6: Create space for your employee to share candid feedback and set short-term growth goals.
