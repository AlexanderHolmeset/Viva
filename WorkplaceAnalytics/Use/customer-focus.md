## Optimize time with customers

Collaboration with customers and other external contacts enables employees to gain the customer and market knowledge needed for business success. Spending time collaborating with customers helps you better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

### Why it matters

The following are based on research presented in the [Loyalty economy: Are you undervaluing your customers?](https://insights.office.com/business-performance/the-loyalty-economy-are-you-undervaluing-customers/), [Optimizing sales and connecting with customers in the age of big data and machine learning](https://insights.office.com/sales-excellence/optimizing-sales-workplace-analytics/), and [What makes great salespeople](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/what-makes-great-salespeople/) articles:

* "...companies at the top of their industries in net promoter scores or satisfaction rankings for three or more years—grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. Yet companies and investors continue to prioritize quarterly earnings over customer relationships..."
* “More time spent with customers; larger internal networks; and more time spent with managers and senior leadership. These three behaviors persisted regardless of region, territory, or sales role, suggesting that they are foundational ingredients for success.”

### Best practices

* Use [MyAnalytics Important people list](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#add-important-people) for key external contacts, which enables immediate notification of email from them, more efficient responses to their requests, and reminders to schedule time to connect with them.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) with key customers for direct, informal chats and prompt responses to urgent requests.

### Change catalyst: Track time with most important external contacts

Create a list of top external, customer relationships and distribute monthly reports to your team that shows how much time was spent with them and how that compares with established goals.

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

See [Promote coaching and development](boost-engagement.md#promote-coaching-and-development) in the Boost engagement outcome for more details about why it matters and the recommended best practices and change catalyst for this one.

## Strengthen internal networks

Employees who maintain strong internal networks are better resourced to meet customer needs and achieve goals.

### Why it matters

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) :

### Best practices

* Improve internal connectivity 
* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) that focus on customer needs.
* Use MyAnalytics to manage important people
Mark key internal contacts as important to never miss emails from them and respond more efficiently.
* Breakdown silos and expand networks with cross-functional goals to help improve communications with isolated teams by assigning interdepartmental liaisons to communicate across teams.

### Change catalyst: Provide managers with go-to contacts list

Survey the group to collect and create a list of contacts that would be a good starting place for employees to contact when trying to establish a new connection. This can empower managers with the right contacts in order to solve their employees' problems. For example:

* Send out a company wide email where people can volunteer to be a connector within their team
* Combine all of these connectors into a list and share that list with managers
* Explain to all employees that managers now have a list of go-to contacts
