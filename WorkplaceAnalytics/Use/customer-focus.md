## About the insights

The following are used to calculate the metrics used for the organizational data shown in the behavioral insights and visual insights.

|Behavior |Percentage insight | Metrics |Calculations |
|---------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Optimize time with customers  |Percentage of employees who are in the top quartile for total collaboration time being with external customers. |<ul><li> _External network_ is the number of people external to the company with whom the employee had at least two [meaningful interactions](glossary.md#meaningful-interaction-definition) in a month. Connected employees have had more than five connections with external people in a month.</li><li>_External collaboration hours_ is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and emails with at least one person outside the company. Connected groups spend a large proportion of their overall collaboration with people outside the company. </li></ul>|Calculation info |
|Promote coaching and development |Percentage of employees who have less than 15 minutes of 1:1 meeting time with their managers each week. |1:1 Coaching meeting time is the number of meeting hours with only an employee and their manager. To account for various meeting frequencies, the total time is calculated for each employee per month and averaged over a week. |Calculation info |
|Strengthen internal networks |Percentage of employees who have fewer than five relationships with internal organizations. |<ul><li>Organizational network analysis hows how employees are connecting internally with other employees and externally with customers. </li><li>Cross-organization collaboration is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and email with at least one person outside of their own department.  </li><li>Focus time is when employees have two or more consecutive hours with no meetings. </li></ul>|Calculation info |

## Optimize time with customers

Collaboration with customers and other external contacts enables employees to gain the customer and market knowledge needed for business success. Spending time collaborating with customers helps you better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

### Why it matters

The following are based on research presented in the [Loyalty economy: Are you undervaluing your customers?](https://insights.office.com/business-performance/the-loyalty-economy-are-you-undervaluing-customers/), [Optimizing sales and connecting with customers in the age of big data and machine learning](https://insights.office.com/sales-excellence/optimizing-sales-workplace-analytics/), and [What makes great salespeople](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/what-makes-great-salespeople/) articles:

* "...companies at the top of their industries in net promoter scores or satisfaction rankings for three or more years—grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. Yet companies and investors continue to prioritize quarterly earnings over customer relationships..."
* “More time spent with customers; larger internal networks; and more time spent with managers and senior leadership. These three behaviors persisted regardless of region, territory, or sales role, suggesting that they are foundational ingredients for success.”

### Best practices

* Use [MyAnalytics Important people list](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#add-important-people) for key external contacts, which enables immediate notification of email from them, more efficient responses to their requests, and reminders to schedule time to connect with them.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) with key customers for direct, informal chats and prompt responses to urgent requests.
* Encourage employees to build deeper relationships with customers. Developing customer empathy enables employees to identify the emotional needs of their customers and understand the reasons why and respond in a way that creates a long-lasting relationship with customers.
* Facilitate direct interaction with customers, even in “back office” functions. Every employee impacts the customer experience in some way and interacting with customers enables a better understanding of customer needs and their successes and challenges.
* Democratize customer insights with customer facing teams that create a culture where customers can help drive decisions.

### Change catalyst: Track time with most important external contacts

Create a list of top external, customer relationships and distribute monthly reports to your team that shows how much time was spent with them and how that compares with established goals.

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

### Why it matters

According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/):

* "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."
* "The opportunity is huge for better-run organizations and a higher quality of life for workers."
* "Bad management is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $398 billion annually."

### Best practices

* Require that managers schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.
* Prepare and remain flexible on discussion points in 1:1s. 1:1s are best with structure but not too much to allow for co-creation. Agree on discussion points at the start and allocate adequate time to the most important topics.
* Lead by example. People are more engaged if they work for a manager who is working at least as much as they are.
* Evenly distribute work. Highly utilized employees often work longer hours than their peers, which can lead to disengagement.
* Maintain large internal networks across the company. Employees who have larger networks than their managers are more likely to view leadership unfavorably. (In order to qualify as a connection, an employee must interact with another person at least two times per month in an email or meeting with five or fewer participants.)

### Change catalyst: Develop a 1:1 conversation series

Managers can use the following meeting agenda outline a guide for creating a series of 1:1 meetings with their employees, remembering to keep questions open-ended to spark discussions.

* Meeting 1: Share some positive feedback with your employee.
* Meeting 2: Explore how your employee interacts with the rest of the team.
* Meeting 3: Understand what your employee likes and dislikes about the job.
* Meeting 4: Define their assigned tasks and help them set priorities.
* Meeting 5: Ask how your employee wants to grow in the future.
* Meeting 6: Create space for your employee to share candid feedback and set short-term growth goals.

## Strengthen internal networks

Employees who maintain strong internal networks are better resourced to meet customer needs and achieve goals. Connecting employees across units creates agile innovation by helping the company leverage benefits of scale, cross-pollinate ideas, and integrate different perspectives.

### Why it matters

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explain how important cross-group collaboration is in getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

### Best practices

* Improve internal connectivity. Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. Employees who maintain large, stable, and diversified internal networks are often better positioned to leverage their connections for quickly responding to customer needs and driving customer satisfaction.
* Identify opportunities to free up employees’ time spent on administrative tasks or internal meetings, so they have more time to spend with customers.
* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) that focus on customer needs.
* Use [MyAnalytics to manage important people](../myanalytics/network.md) to mark key internal contacts as important to never miss emails from them and respond more efficiently.
* Breakdown silos and expand networks with cross-functional goals to help improve communications with isolated teams by assigning interdepartmental liaisons to communicate across teams.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

### Change catalyst: Provide managers with go-to contacts list

Survey the group to collect and create a list of contacts that would be a good starting place for employees to contact when trying to establish a new connection. This can empower managers with the right contacts in order to solve their employees' problems. For example:

* Send out a company wide email where people can volunteer to be a connector within their team
* Combine all of these connectors into a list and share that list with managers
* Explain to all employees that managers now have a list of go-to contacts
