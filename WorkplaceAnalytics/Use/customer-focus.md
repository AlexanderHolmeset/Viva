# Increase customer focus

Companies that prioritize customer relationships and satisfaction grow revenue faster than competitors. Research shows that companies that prioritize customer relationships and satisfaction grow revenue 2.5 times faster than their competitors.

Each of the following behaviors show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data. You can select **Take action** to see ways you can drive change or simply maintain your organization's focus on customers.

## Optimize time with customers

Collaboration with customers and other external contacts enables employees to gain the customer and market knowledge needed for business success. Spending time collaborating with customers helps you better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

### Why it matters

The following are based on research presented in the [Loyalty economy: Are you undervaluing your customers?](https://insights.office.com/business-performance/the-loyalty-economy-are-you-undervaluing-customers/), [Optimizing sales and connecting with customers in the age of big data and machine learning](https://insights.office.com/sales-excellence/optimizing-sales-workplace-analytics/), and [What makes great salespeople](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/what-makes-great-salespeople/) articles:

* "...companies at the top of their industries in net promoter scores or satisfaction rankings for three or more years—grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. Yet companies and investors continue to prioritize quarterly earnings over customer relationships..."
* “More time spent with customers; larger internal networks; and more time spent with managers and senior leadership. These three behaviors persisted regardless of region, territory, or sales role, suggesting that they are foundational ingredients for success.”

### Best practices

* Use [MyAnalytics Important people list](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#add-important-people) for key external contacts, which enables immediate notification of email from them, more efficient responses to their requests, and reminders to schedule time to connect with them.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) with key customers for direct, informal chats and prompt responses to urgent requests.
* Encourage employees to build deeper relationships with customers. Developing customer empathy enables employees to identify the emotional needs of their customers and understand the reasons why and respond in a way that creates a long-lasting relationship with customers.
* Facilitate direct interaction with customers, even in “back office” functions. Every employee impacts the customer experience in some way and interacting with customers enables a better understanding of customer needs and their successes and challenges.
* Democratize customer insights with customer facing teams that create a culture where customers can help drive decisions.

### Change catalyst: Track time with most important external contacts

Create a list of top external, customer relationships and distribute monthly reports to your team that shows how much time was spent with them and how that compares with established goals.

## Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

See [Promote coaching and development](boost-engagement.md#promote-coaching-and-development) in the Boost engagement outcome for more details about why it matters and the recommended best practices and change catalyst for this one.

## Strengthen internal networks

Employees who maintain strong internal networks are better resourced to meet customer needs and achieve goals. Connecting employees across units creates agile innovation by helping the company leverage benefits of scale, cross-pollinate ideas, and integrate different perspectives.

### Why it matters

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article explain how important cross-group collaboration is in getting work done:

* “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."
* "Intuitively, we know that the collaborative intensity of work has skyrocketed, and that collaborations are central to agility."
* "Yet most organizations don’t manage internal collaboration productively, and assume that technology or formal org charts can yield agility.”

### Best practices

* Improve internal connectivity. Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. Employees who maintain large, stable, and diversified internal networks are often better positioned to leverage their connections for quickly responding to customer needs and driving customer satisfaction.
* Identify opportunities to free up employees’ time spent on administrative tasks or internal meetings, so they have more time to spend with customers.
* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) that focus on customer needs.
* Use MyAnalytics to manage important people
Mark key internal contacts as important to never miss emails from them and respond more efficiently.
* Breakdown silos and expand networks with cross-functional goals to help improve communications with isolated teams by assigning interdepartmental liaisons to communicate across teams.
* Map the interdependencies between diﬀerent teams where central players contribute, to understand and plan for potential risks. Have a back-up plan to cover such emergencies.
* Pair newcomers and network inﬂuencers through staﬃng or mentoring. This simple practice triples newcomer connectivity compared to those who do not get this experience.
* Set up “communities of practice” or business development initiatives to help share expertise or resources.
* Set speciﬁc goals and reward agile collaboration. Peer feedback helps to identify people whom the formal performance reviews might otherwise overlook.

### Change catalyst: Provide managers with go-to contacts list

Survey the group to collect and create a list of contacts that would be a good starting place for employees to contact when trying to establish a new connection. This can empower managers with the right contacts in order to solve their employees' problems. For example:

* Send out a company wide email where people can volunteer to be a connector within their team
* Combine all of these connectors into a list and share that list with managers
* Explain to all employees that managers now have a list of go-to contacts

## About the metrics

The following describes the data related to each recommended action and its best practices.

|Behavior |Insight | Metrics |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Optimize time with customers  |Percentage of employees who are in the top quartile for total collaboration time being with external customers. |<ul><li> _External network_ is the number of people external to the company with whom the employee had at least two [meaningful interactions](glossary.md#meaningful-interaction-definition) in a month. Connected employees have had more than five connections with external people in a month.</li><li>_External collaboration hours_ is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and emails with at least one person outside the company. Connected groups spend a large proportion of their overall collaboration with people outside the company. </li></ul>|
|Promote coaching and development |Percentage of employees who have less than 15 minutes of 1:1 meeting time with their managers each week. |1:1 Coaching meeting time is the number of meeting hours with only an employee and their manager. To account for various meeting frequencies, the total time is calculated for each employee per month and averaged over a week. |
|Strengthen internal networks |Percentage of employees who have fewer than five relationships with internal organizations. |<ul><li>Organizational network analysis hows how employees are connecting internally with other employees and externally with customers. </li><li>Cross-organization collaboration is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and email with at least one person outside of their own department.  </li><li>Focus time is when employees have two or more consecutive hours with no meetings. </li></ul>|
