# Workplace Analytics Home

As a business leader, an analyst, or a program manager, you can use the new **Home** page to see research-based insights into how your organization gets work done. It also empowers you to explain and predict the impact of daily activity and to drive opportunities for change within your organization.

![Home page](../images/wpa/use/wpa-home.png)

## Analysis audience

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis. This data is based on the most recent organizational data uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, which includes the current date range and the number of measured employees, managers, teams, and organizational levels. For more details, see [Organizational data](data-sourcesv2.md#organizational-data).

## Why it matters

Each business insight includes a leading indicator and an explanation of why it's important to you. The insights also explain how Workplace Analytics can help you understand what your organization is doing now and how you can drive change.

Select **Get the answers** to see how your organizational data relates to this specific business insight.

## Supporting evidence

Each insight includes **Supporting evidence** that links you to a related article at [Microsoft Workplace Insights](https://insights.office.com/), which has a variety of articles by industry experts based on research and by other organizations that have effectively used Workplace Analytics to improve their business outcomes.

## Explore the stats

Depending on the insight and your role, **Explore the stats** links you either to a recommended plan or to related **Explore** pages within Workplace Analytics for more in-depth analysis.

For example, as an analyst, if you select **Explore the metrics** in **Organizational agility** > **Are managers accessing diverse information?**, you'll see your organization's **Network diversity** data in the **Explore** > **Internal** networks page. For more details, see [Internal networks](explore-metrics-internal-networks.md).

## View recommended plan

As an analyst or group manager, you'll also see an option to **View recommended plan** for each business insight. You can use this option to take immediate action for the groups listed in that specific insight. For more details about creating plans, see [Create a plan](../tutorials/solutionsv2-task.md#create-a-plan).

## Employee experience

This section focuses on how well your organization is taking care of employees. A positive employee experience reduces turnover, boosts productivity, and leads to happier employees.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research proves that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity, greater employee retainment, and greater customer satisfaction.

## Organizational agility

This section focuses on organizational behaviors that can affect business success. Nimble companies can efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage.

For example, do your employees have time to focus on their work? Research shows that employees who have time to focus on deep work can master difficult tasks and produce higher quality work.

## Customer focus

This section focuses on how well your organization is engaging customers. Fully engaged customers directly relate to increased profitability, revenue, and relationship growth.

For example, you can use Workplace Analytics to answer questions such as:

* Are employees engaged often and deeply with customers?
* Are employees spending too much time on internal processes?
* Are the right employees spending time with customers?

More information about customers and actionable insights based on customer focus time is coming soon to Workplace Analytics.
