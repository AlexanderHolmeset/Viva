## Analysis scope

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis. This data is based on the most recent organizational HR and collaboration data uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, which includes the current date range and the number of measured employees, managers, teams, and organizational levels. For more details, see [Organizational data](organizational-data.md) and [Office 365 data](office-365-data.md).

## Employee experience

Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover. These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your organization is working after hours on email or instant messages.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

## About the metrics

The following describes how the metrics are calculated to support the behavioral insights for each of the business insight questions.

|Business insight question |Metric description  |
|---------|--------------------|
|Are employees getting enough time with their managers? |One-on-one time is the number of meeting hours with only an employee and their manager. To account for various meeting frequencies, the total time is calculated for each employee per month and averaged over a week. |
|Are employees working after hours? |After-hours work is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and on email outside of working hours. This uses the working hours set in the employee's Outlook calendar settings. |
|Are employees overwhelmed by email? |Employees that spend over 10 hours in email each week. Email workload is the number of hours employees spend sending and receiving email.|
|Are employees burdened by long and large meetings? |The number of employees that spend over 50 percent of their total meeting time in long or large meetings, divided by the total number of measured employees. Long meetings are those scheduled for more than an hour. Large meetings are those that involve more than eight people.|
|Do employees have time to focus? |The number of employees who have less than 20 hours each of available time for focused work, divided by the total number of measured employees. Focus time is when employees have two or more consecutive hours with no meetings. |
