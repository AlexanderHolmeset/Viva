# Workplace Analytics Home

As a business leader, an analyst, or a program manager, the new Home page gives you research-based insights into how your organization gets work done and empowers you to explain and predict the impact of daily activity and to drive opportunities for change.

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis, which is based on the most recent organizational data uploaded and processed in Workplace Analytics, including the current date range, the number of measured employees, managers, teams, and organizational levels.

## Why it matters

The business insights include leading indicators that explain why they are important to you. Each insight also explains how Workplace Analytics can help you understand what your organization is doing now and how you can drive change.

Select **See the answers** to see how your organizational data relates to this business insight category.

## Supporting evidence

Each business insight includes **Supporting evidence** that links you a related article at [Microsoft Workplace Insights](https://insights.office.com/), which includes articles by industry experts based on research and by other organizations that have effectively used similar analysis to improve their business outcomes.

## Explore the stats

Depending on the insight and your role, **Explore the stats** links you either to identify a plan or to related Explore pages for more in-depth analysis within Workplace Analytics.

For example, as an analyst, if you select **Explore the metrics** in **Organizational agility** > **Are managers accessing diverse information?**, you'll see your organization's **Network diversity** data in the **Explore** > **Internal** networks page. For more details, see [Internal networks](explore-metrics-internal-networks.md).

## View recommended plan

Depending on your role, you'll either see a **Share** or a **View recommended plan** link. This enables immediate impact by creating a plan for the groups listed in that specific insight.

For example, as an analyst, if you select **View recommended plan**, a pane opens to set up a new plan for the listed groups. For more details about creating plans, see [Define the plan](../tutorials/solutionsv2-task#define-the-plan.md).

## Employee experience

This section focuses on how well your organization is taking care of employees. A positive employee experience reduces turnover, boosts productivity, and leads to happier employees.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research proves that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity, higher employee retainment, and higher customer satisfaction.

## Organizational agility

This section focuses on organizational behaviors that can affect business success. Nimble companies can efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage.

For example, do your employees have time to focus on their work? Research shows that employees who have time to focus on deep work can master difficult tasks and produce higher quality work.

## Customer focus

This section focuses on how well your organization is engaging customers. Fully engaged customers directly relate to increased profitability, revenue, and relationship growth.

For example, are the right employees spending time with customers or are employees spending too much time on internal processes?

More information about customers and actionable insights based on customer focus time will be coming soon to Workplace Analytics.
