## Best practices to transform meeting culture

### Optimize meeting hours

Long and large meetings are costly and often considered a waste of time. Shorter meetings with fewer people can enhance individual and team performance.

The [condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance."

Ways to optimize meetings:

* Microsoft Teams channels provide team members with a new way to get questions answered and provide updates without the need for a meeting.  
* Encourage employees to politely say no to meetings that lack an agenda or are misaligned with priorities. The feedback will motivate organizers to more carefully plan.

### Examine recurring meetings

Recurring meetings for team updates often consume large amounts of time. Over time they can become bloated with attendees, unproductive and disconnected from original goals.

As described in [How to finally kill the useless, recurring meeting](https://insights.office.com/digital-transformation/how-to-finally-kill-the-useless-recurring-meeting/), we all know how wasteful a "bloated" weekly meeting can be. But there's hope: "To liberate victims from this seemingly inescapable vicious cycle, it’s necessary to kick-start a virtuous cycle in which everyone is empowered to say no, ask why, and identify strategies to allow everyone in an organization to be more effective on a day-to-day basis."

Ways to optimize recurring meetings:

* Microsoft Teams channels provide team members with a new way to get questions answered and provide updates without the need for a meeting.  
* Experiment with 15 minute meetings: Short meetings with focused agendas are common in high-stakes workplaces to debrief or reflect on an event.

### Promote healthy meeting habits

Emailing and chatting during meetings can lead to different interpretations of decisions, missed guidance and inconsistent follow-through on action items.

According to [If you multitask during meetings, your team will, too](https://insights.office.com/productivity/multitask-meetings-team-will/): “Managers that frequently send emails during meetings are, according to our analysis, are 2.2 times more likely to have direct reports who also multi-task in meetings.”

Ways to promote healthier meetings:

* Use the MyAnalytics Outlook add-in to prepare for meetings. It provides insights about meeting information, related documents, and reminders to book preparation time.
* When distracted by a thought to send an email during a meeting, add it quickly to your to-do list instead and move on. This provides satisfaction and can help you regain focus.
