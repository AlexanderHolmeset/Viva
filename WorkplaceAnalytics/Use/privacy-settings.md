# Privacy settings

**Owner** â€“ Only Workplace Analytics Admins have full access to this page. For details, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).

In **Settings** > **Admin settings** > **Privacy**, you can decide what data you want to exclude from analysis and what data you want visible in [Queries](../Tutorials/Query-basics.md) and [Explore the stats](../Use/explore-intro.md). Watch the [Privacy video](#privacy-video) to learn more about how Workplace Analytics keeps personal data private. You can use privacy settings to:

* [Set the minimum group size](#minimum-group-size)
* [Hash subject lines](#hash-subject-lines)
* [Exclude domains or email addresses](#exclude-domains-or-email-addresses)
* [Exclude terms from subject lines](#exclude-terms-from-subject-lines)

![Admin privacy settings](../images/wpa/use/privacy-settings.png)

After you change privacy settings, your changes take effect after data is processed in the following week. This means that these changes do not affect data that has already been extracted. (For example, the privacy settings for excluding email, meetings, and domains do not affect data retroactively.)

## Minimum group size

The minimum-group-size rule protects people from being identified in [Explore the stats](../Use/explore-intro.md) and in [Plans](../tutorials/solutionsv2-intro.md) data. If you change this setting, your change takes effect immediately.

The default minimum-group setting is *five*, which is the *minimum allowed value*. You can change this setting according to the privacy requirements of your specific organization.

For example, the columns on the left in the following graphic shows chart data for groups that exceed the minimum-group setting. The grayed-out columns on the right represent *unavailable data* for the groups with fewer people than the minimum-group setting.

   ![Bar chart with bars above and below the minimum-group setting](../images/wpa/group-size-bars.png)

> [!Note]
> The minimum-group-size rule applies to charts that are derived from HR data, which is information about your organization, such as managers at a specific level or employees in a particular city.

**Histogram charts are an exception**

For histogram charts, the minimum-group-size rule is applied differently, in the following ways:

1. If the filter group is too small, no histogram appears.

   If the filter group that the histogram uses for its data is below the minimum group size, Workplace Analytics does not display the histogram at all.

2. If the bin population is too small, the bin still appears.

   In histograms, the x-axis consists of bins (rectangles) that are based on average metric values, and the y-axis determines the number of people whose average metric value puts them in that bin. *These values do not reflect organizational (HR) data.* So the histogram can still show data for a bin even if it contains fewer people than the minimum-group setting. Histogram charts can safely show this data because the data is based on calculations from observed behavior, *not from HR data*.

   Even if a histogram bin has data for only one person, it can still show that data. You cannot single out the person because you don't know which HR group they belong to. (In other charts, such as column charts, a person in a group below the threshold might be identifiable, but in a histogram the HR group to which people belong is the larger filter group.) You also cannot determine the precise metric value of specific people because they are in a bin with a minimum 0.5-hour range.
  
   You can see histogram charts in the following areas of Workplace Analytics:

   * In [Management and coaching](../use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching.md)
   * In [Plans](../Tutorials/solutionsv2-intro.md), on the **Identify** and **Track** pages

## Hash subject lines

Use this setting to control whether to show or hash subject lines in [Meeting query](../tutorials/meeting-queries.md) results, which, by default, are *not* shown.

If you select **Yes** for **Hash subject lines**, they are converted to a hashed value (a system-generated number), so the text in unreadable in any queries. You can still create meeting queries that include subject-line terms, such as for meeting attributes. However, you won't be able to see a list of meetings that show the subject lines. (After you make this setting, it takes effect immediately, affecting data that has already been processed.)

For example, you could run a query with the subject-line keyword "All-hands." Based on the attributes you include in the query, the results could show data with that subject line, including the number of meetings, the length and size of the meetings, and so on. However, you could not get a specific list of all the meetings with the subject line "All-hands" (a row for each all-hands meeting).

> [!Note]
> Workplace Analytics offers a second opportunity to control which HR attributes are included in query output. You can make selections for the "Include in report" and "Hash in report" options in a dropdown menu when you map uploaded HR data. For more information, see the descriptions of **Include in report** and **Hash in report** in the **Field mapping** section of [Upload organizational data](../setup/upload-organizational-data.md#columns-in-the-fields-tables).

## Exclude domains or email addresses

You can exclude data from specific domains or data that includes specific email addresses:

* In **Exclude domains**, you can enter one or more domains to exclude from analysis. Any email, meetings, calls, or instant messages that involve people included in these domains will be excluded from any queries.

* In **Exclude email addresses**, you can enter one or more email addresses to exclude from analysis. Any email and meetings that have these email addresses (as either sender or recipient, and attendee or invitee) are now excluded from analysis. For this setting, you need to enter every email address for each alias that you want to exclude.

  > [!Important]
  > Be sure to ask your Office 365 admin to not assign licenses to any excluded email addresses.

## Exclude terms from subject lines

Subject lines are useful for analysts who want to set up meeting exclusion rules or to query meeting data. You can enter a list of specific keywords or terms that occur in the subject lines of emails and meetings that you want to exclude from analysis.

Terms can be any combination of letters, numbers and special characters (such as client attorney privilege or D&I).

## Exclusion setting considerations

Any domains, email addresses, or terms you exclude will not be included in any of the analysis, so it's important to carefully consider the implications of an exclusion and balance them with your privacy and data-analysis goals. If you exclude a domain or term that frequently appears in the collaboration dataset, it could adversely skew your analysis. Exclusion occurs before metadata is processed within Workplace Analytics. This means that, after you make an exclusion setting, the setting does not affect data that has already been processed.

If you exclude the email address of the CEO (ceo@company.com), all meetings and emails in which the CEO is included are removed from analysis. So for all meetings and emails that include the CEO, the metadata for all other recipients and attendees included in those same emails and meetings is also excluded from analysis.

To exclude all email that contains the keywords "confidential," "ACP," and "privileged," you would type: **confidential;ACP;privileged**

## Exclusion logic

* You can use upper or lower-case keywords.
* Must match exact string for subject keywords.
* Does not match partial words; you must list all partial words as separate terms.

 When you add subject-line terms to exclude from analysis, Workplace Analytics might not recognize uncommon compound words, especially those in languages such as Japanese or Chinese. For best results, use single words, separated by semicolons.

Term from subject line to exclude | Actual subject line | Excluded
---------|----------|---------
 legal;acquisition | Verify this is LEGAL | Yes - Case is ignored
 legal;acquisition | Is this illegal | No - Does not match partial words, and did not exclude illegal
 legal;acquisition | Acquisitions are finalized | No - Does not match partial words, and did not exclude acquisitions
 legal;acquisition |Is this a legal acquisition | Yes  - Excluded both legal and acquisition

## To configure privacy settings

1. In **Admin settings** > **Privacy settings**, for **Minimum group size to display in visual dashboards**, set the minimum group size. You cannot use a value lower than 5.

   >[!Note]
   >The following exclusion settings are optional and only change query results. These settings do not change the way a query functions.

2. In **Hash subject lines**, select **Yes** to hash subject lines in query results.
3. In **Exclude domains**, type one or more domains to exclude.
4. In **Exclude email addresses**, type one or more email addresses to exclude.
5. In **Exclude terms from subject lines**, type one or more terms or keywords to exclude.
6. Carefully confirm all settings, and then select **I confirm that all privacy settings are correct**. Settings can be finalized only when you select this check box.
7. At the top right of the page, select **Save**.

>[!Important]
>* All subsequent changes to privacy settings after the initial setup, take affect on the next data refresh of your organizational (HR) data or Office 365 collaboration data.
>* Changes to **Hash subject lines** take affect immediately in meeting query results.
>* Changes to the **minimum group** and **Hash subject lines** settings apply retroactively to *all data*, including historical data.
>* Changes to the other exclude from analysis settings apply only to *new data* collected during the next data refresh and do not affect historical data.
