# Workplace Analytics Home page for People Managers

As a people manager, the **Home** page gives you research-based behavioral insights into how your team gets work done.

## Analysis scope

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis. This data is based on the most recent organizational data uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, which includes the current date range and the number of measured employees in your team. For more details about uploads and measured employees, see [Organizational data](organizational-data.md).

## Employee experience

A positive employee experience reduces turnover, boosts productivity, and leads to happier employees.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

## Organizational agility

Nimble teams can efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage.

For example, do your employees have time to focus on their work? Research shows that employees who have time to focus on deep work can master difficult tasks and produce higher quality work.

## Supporting evidence

Each insight includes **Supporting evidence** that links you to a related article at [Microsoft Workplace Insights](https://insights.office.com/). These articles are authored by:

* Industry experts based on research.
* Organizations that have effectively used Workplace Analytics to improve their business outcomes.

## Differential privacy

Differential privacy is the acceptable deviation of keeping individual employees data private without comprising the accuracy of the metrics shown. Workplace Analytics hides metric details at the aggregation level. And noise or de-identified data is used to protect employee privacy when manager pivot or filter for more specific data points.

## View recommended plan

As people manager, you'll also see an option to **View recommended plan** for each business insight. You can use this option to take immediate action for the groups listed in that specific insight. For more details about creating plans, see [Create a plan](../tutorials/solutionsv2-task.md#create-a-plan).
