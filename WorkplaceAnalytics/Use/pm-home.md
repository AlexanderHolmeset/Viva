# Workplace Analytics Home pages for people managers

As a people manager, you can use the **Home** pages to see research-based behavioral insights into how your organization gets work done.

## Analysis scope

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis. This data is based on the most recent organizational data uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, which includes the current date range and the number of measured employees in your team. For more details about uploads and measured employees, see [Organizational data](organizational-data.md).

## Employee experience

A positive employee experience reduces turnover, boosts productivity, and leads to happier employees.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

## Organizational agility

Nimble teams can efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage.

For example, do your employees have time to focus on their work? Research shows that employees who have time to focus on deep work can master difficult tasks and produce higher quality work.

The following describes how the metrics are calculated to support the behavioral insights shown in the middle section for each business insight question about teams that are similar to yours, as shown to the right of each business insight question.

## Differential privacy

Differential privacy is a technology that allows researchers and analysts to pull useful information from databases containing personal information while simultaneously protecting individual privacy. This is achieved by introducing slight variations to the data to protect privacy while still maintaining accuracy, so managers have confidence in the observed values.

To learn more about differential privacy, read [Differential Privacy for Everyone](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/1/F/D1F0DFF5-8BA9-4BDF-8924-7816932F6825/Differential_Privacy_for_Everyone.pdf).

## View recommended plan

As people manager, you'll also see an option to **View recommended plan** for each business insight. You can use this option to take immediate action for the groups listed in that specific insight. For more details about creating plans, see [Create a plan](../tutorials/solutionsv2-task.md#create-a-plan).
