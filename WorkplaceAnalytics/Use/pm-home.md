# Workplace Analytics Home

As a people manager, the **Home** page gives you research-based behavioral insights into how your team gets work done.

## Analysis scope

The top right of the page shows who is included in this analysis. This data is based on the most recent organizational data uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, which includes the current date range and the number of measured employees in your team. For more details about uploads and measured employees, see [Organizational data](organizational-data.md).

## Employee experience

A positive employee experience reduces turnover, boosts productivity, and leads to happier employees.

For example, are employees routinely getting one-on-one time with their managers? Research shows that employees who get consistent manager coaching are five times more likely to stay engaged, which leads to increased productivity and greater employee retainment.

For example, do your employees have time to focus on their work? Research shows that employees who have time to focus on deep work can master difficult tasks and produce higher quality work.
