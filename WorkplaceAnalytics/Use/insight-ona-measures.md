# Organizational network measures

The organizational network graphs used for some of the Workplace Analytics visual insights use a number of measures to help you visualize and analyze collaborative relationships within your organization.

The following is an example of an Employee empowerment network graph.

## Nodes

In the network graphs, each dot or node represents an employee or a group. The node measures for employees are de-identified to maintain their privacy. Group node measures represent the group's measures, such as for a department (Sales) or a functional group (program managers) within the organization.

## Colors

The node colors represent the level of it in the graph as indicated by the legend. The darker the color the greater representation that node has in comparison with others in the network. The lighter the node color is, the less representative it is as compared to the population shown in the graph.

## Clusters

The node clusters shown are formed naturally in an organizational network graph when it uses the force-directed graph drawing algorithm. A node with strong connections are very likely clustered together in a graph. For the majority, a cluster represents a division or department in an organization.

## Available network graphs

For calculation information about a specific network graph, select the following applicable visual insight.

* [Employee empowerment](improve-agility.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the number of empowered employees and disempowered employees in your organization. This helps identify who controls information and where it is concentrated in your organization. You can use these insights to democratize information to improve transparency and decision-making throughout.
* [Cohesion within teams](boost-engagement.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the teams with strong cohesion and those without strong cohesion based on average monthly collaboration activity within the teamâ€™s network.
* [Collaboration across groups](improve-agility.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the number of groups with high cross-group collaboration and the groups for low cross-group collaboration within your organization. This can help identify organizational silos and agile teams currently working within the network.
* [Collaboration across teams](foster-innovation.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the number of teams with high cross-group collaboration as compared to other teams in your organization.
* [Distribution of potential manager candidates](accelerate-change.md#about-the-insights) - Represents the current managers and potential managers as compared with the other employees within your organization, based on their network connections.
* [Internal network connections by employee network strength](customer-focus.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the number of employees with strong internal networks as compared to all other employees in your organization.
* Managers and cross-group connectivity - Shows the number of well-connected managers and less-connected managers as compared to all other employees within your organization, based on their network connections.
* [Reach of influencers](accelerate-change.md#about-the-insights) - Shows the reach of influencers, their connections, and how they compare to other employees within your organization. This identifies groups who power the unobservable communication networks that shape culture and drive change. You can then target these influencers to accelerate the adoption of new technology.

## Are the measures for employees and groups different?

No, the measure interpretations for employees and groups are the same. For example:

* If an employee has a high degree, it indicates the person has more connections in the network than those with lower scores and therefore has more exposure or access to information.
* If a group has a high degree, it indicates the group has more connections in the network than other groups with lower scores and therefore has more exposure or access to information.

In terms of calculations, group measures are not simply the average (or median, maximum, or minimum) of the scores of the employees within the group. Instead, the measures are the cumulative scores of how the people within the group interact with people in other groups. In some cases, the two may be equal but that's generally not the case. The key difference is that the group measures do not account for connections that occur between members of the same group.

A simple analogy of this is a water molecule, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. If you average together the properties of hydrogen and oxygen (both gases), it won't generate the properties of a water molecule because the bonds between atoms are important to its properties.

Just like atoms and molecules, how people are connected within an organizational group makes the properties of the group different than the average properties of the individual people within the group.
