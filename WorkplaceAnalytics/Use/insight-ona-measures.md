# Organizational network metrics

The organizational network graphs used for some of the Workplace Analytics visual insights use the influence metric to help you visualize and analyze relationships within your organization.

The following is an example of an Employee empowerment network graph.

## Nodes

In the network graphs, each dot or node represents an employee in the organization. Node size corresponds to an individualâ€™s influence score. Employees with greater scores are represented by larger nodes in the graphs.

The node colors depend on the specific insight as indicated in the graph legends. Gray nodes with no corresponding legend represent those with incomplete manager hierarchy information, managers with missing licenses, or where the employee or manager influence scores are zero.

## Available network graphs

For calculation information about a specific network graph, select the applicable behavior.

* [Accelerate decision making](improve-agility.md#visual-insights) - The **Employee empowerment** graph shows the general distribution of empowered employees and disempowered employees in your organization. This helps identify information sharing patterns, and where they are well represented in your organization. You can use this insight to understand at a high level which parts of your organization could benefit from better information sharing practices.
* [Engage influencers](accelerate-change.md#visual-insights) - The **Reach of influencers** graph shows the influencers, their connections, and how they are able to effectively connect across your organization. This shows people who power the unobservable communication networks that you can target to effectively drive change.
* [Strengthen management pipeline](develop-managers.md#visual-insights) - The **Distribution of potential manager candidates** graph shows the distribution of current managers, potential managers, and other employees within your organization, based on influence scores. You can use this insight to evaluate future managers with high influence scores who are currently not in managerial roles.
