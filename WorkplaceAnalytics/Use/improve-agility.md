Each of the following behaviors show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data.

## Best practices to improve agility

### Organize better meetings

Long and large meetings are costly and often considered a waste of time. Shorter and smaller meetings provide the conditions for effective decision-making.

<!-- <check out improving meeting quality in effective-operations, do they overlap? however, the figma and spreadsheet names don't match, the spreadsheet shows "Free up capacity" which lists different stuff, so?? -->

### Accelerate decision-making

Agile organizations are transparent and freely share information to avoid miscommunication and enable smart and timely decision making.


### Foster cross-group collaboration

Agile organizations rely on a network of highly-connected teams that actively collaborate together with a shared understanding of the collective mission.

### Improve management practices

When managers are needed in more meetings than they can attend, they become obstacles to team goal attainment and create bottlenecks in decision making.

The level of day-to-day collaboration between managers and their employees can indicate whether employees feel empowered to take initiative and work independently, or if they struggle to separate themselves from their manager.

Ways to improve:

* Push ownership down to the level of action.
* Enable and use [Insights](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#prepare-for-your-meetings) to manage your calendar and increase your awareness of conflicting meetings and meetings that keep you informed of decisions.
