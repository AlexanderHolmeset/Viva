# Improve agility

Companies that redefine industries and lead markets are less bureaucratic and nimbly adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer needs.

Each of the following behaviors show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data.

* [Organize better meetings](#organize-better-meetings)
* [Accelerate decision-making](#accelerate-decision-making)
* [Improve management practices](#improve-management-practices)
<!--
* [Foster cross-group collaboration](#foster-cross-group-collaboration)

## Percentage insights

The following are the percentage insights, their underlying metrics, and a little about the calculations used for them.

![Improve agility percentage insight](../images/wpa/use/improve-agility-percent.png)

|Behavior |Percentage insight | Metrics |Calculations |
|---------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Organize better meetings |Percentage of employees who spend a majority of their meeting time in long or large meetings | [Attendees](metric-definitions.md#attendees-define), [Attendee meeting hours](metric-definitions.md#attendee-meeting-hours-define), [Long meetings](glossary.md#long-meeting-define), [Large meetings](glossary.md#large-meeting-define)| The percentage of employees who spend over 50 percent of their meeting hours with in long or large meetings. The insight is calculated weekly and averaged over all weeks.  |
|Accelerate decision-making |Percentage of employees who could be empowered to make faster decisions | [Influence](metric-definitions.md#influence-define)  |Employees whose influence score is within 25 percent of their manager's influence score are considered empowered employees. This insight calculates the number of employees who are empowered over all measured employees.  |
|Improve management practices |Percentage of managers who have a majority of thier schedule double-booked | [Attendees with conflicting meeting](metric-definitions.md#attendees-with-conflicting-meeting-define) |The percentage of employees who more than 50 percent of their meeting hours in conflicting meetings. This insight is calculated weekly and averaged over all the weeks.  |

## Visual insights

The following defines the organizational data shown in the visual behavioral insights.

![Improve agility visual insight](../images/wpa/use/impr-agil-improv-mgmt-prac.png)

|Behavior |Visual insight | Definition |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Improve management practices | Distribution of conflicting meeting hours | Shows the percentage of employees according to the number of their [conflicting meeting](glossary.md#conflicting-meeting-define) hours. These percentages are calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period.  |
| Organize better meetings | Meetings by duration and number of attendees  | Shows the percentages of meetings that are [long meetings](glossary.md#long-meeting-define), [large meetings](glossary.md#large-meeting-define), [long and large meetings](glossary.md#long-and-large-meeting-define), and finally, the type to strive for: [decision-making meetings](glossary.md#decision-making-meeting-define). |
| Accelerate decision-making | Employee empowerment | [An organizational network graph](insight-ona-measures.md) that shows the distribution of empowered employees and disempowered employees in your organization. This helps identify information sharing patterns, and where they are well represented in your organization. You can use this insight to understand at a high level which parts of your organization could benefit from better information sharing practices. This graph uses [influence metrics](metric-definitions.md#organizational-network-analysis-ona-metrics). |

## Take action

You can select **Take action** to see ways you can drive change or simply maintain organizational agility. The following are available in addition to the recommendations within Take action.

* **Opportunity groups** - Lists the groups who are most affected and would benefit the most from these recommended best practices, which are based on your organizational data and industry research.
* **Explore**  â€“ Depending on your role and the best practice, you might see [Explore the stats](explore-intro.md) or [Explore in Power BI](../tutorials/power-bi-intro.md) links for using Explore or Power BI reports for more advanced analysis, including more detailed charts and reports.
* **Plans** - As a business leader or a program manager, you can use this link to create and track [Plans](../Tutorials/solutionsv2-intro.md) for your organization.

## Best practices to improve agility

### Organize better meetings

Long and large meetings are costly and often considered a waste of time. Shorter and smaller meetings provide the conditions for effective decision-making.

<!-- <check out improving meeting quality in effective-operations, do they overlap? however, the figma and spreadsheet names don't match, the spreadsheet shows "Free up capacity" which lists different stuff, so?? -->

Ways to organize better meetings:

* When composing a meeting invitation with a duration of one hour, note the MyAnalytics reminder that suggests that you  shorten the meeting by 15 minutes.
* When preparing the agenda, include the purpose of each participant's attendance. The exercise reveals unnecessary invitees, including people who are optional or only require meeting notes.	

For more best practices, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md) and [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

### Accelerate decision-making

Agile organizations are transparent and freely share information to avoid miscommunication and enable smart and timely decision making.

Ways to accelerate decision-making:

* Record meetings and share recordings in public channels whenever possible. Also, provide wide access to meeting notes using Teams and OneNote.
* Create Teams channels for teams to easily share information as it emerges both formally through notes and files and informally through chat.

For more best practices and ways to develop a 1:1 conversation series, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

<!--
### Foster cross-group collaboration

Agile organizations rely on a network of highly-connected teams that actively collaborate together with a shared understanding of the collective mission.

Ways to foster cross-group collaboration:

* Build community by promoting information sharing and community building. Do this, for example, through cross-functional projects and communication about strategic topics carried out in Microsoft Teams channels.
* The MyAnalytics network dashboard shows your connections and top collaborators, and gives you suggestions on how to improve connections with your most important contacts.

For more best practices and how to create goals across teams or departments, see [Best practices for cross-group collaboration](../tutorials/gm-cgcollaboration.md).

### Improve management practices

When managers are needed in more meetings than they can attend, they become obstacles to team goal attainment and create bottlenecks in decision making.

The level of day-to-day collaboration between managers and their employees can indicate whether employees feel empowered to take initiative and work independently, or if they struggle to separate themselves from their manager.

Ways to improve:

* Push ownership down to the level of action.
* Enable and use [Insights](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#prepare-for-your-meetings) to manage your calendar and increase your awareness of conflicting meetings and meetings that keep you informed of decisions.
