# Microsoft Viva Insights app - My Team

## Overview

If you are the manager of a team, you can use the My Team page of the Microsoft Viva Insights app to get a snapshot of how your team is doing. The My Team page does this by presenting team outcomes to focus on. It also shows leading indicators for each outcome, which help you see why it's important to pay attention to that outcome at the moment: 

![Outcomes page](../images/wpa/use/my-org-page-70.png)

While you can also seed these outcomes and their related best practices in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them in Teams, the tool that you're already using for communicating during remote work, the tool you use for meeting, sharing files, and sending IMs to employees and other leaders. 

#### Personal insights are also available

In addition to information about your team, the Viva Insights app also offers you two [personal insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app), insights that help any employee with their daily work and are not specifically intended for managers:
 * **Stay connected** – This insight helps you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues through features such as AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. For more information about the Stay connected feature, see [Stay connected](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#stay-connected).  
 * **Protect time** – This insight helps you find more time to eliminate distractions, stop multi-tasking, and focus on your core priorities. For more information about Protect time feature, see [Protect time](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#protect-time-tab).

## Data privacy 

For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in the Viva Insights app, see [Viva Insights app / Privacy guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#privacy-guide). 

## Prerequisites

To use the My Team page of the Viva Insights app, you need the following:
* An admin has granted you manager access. (This is done on the [Manager settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/workplace-analytics/use/settings#manager-settings) page of Workplace Analytics.)

## Install Viva Insights 

This section describes how to install the Viva Insights app for yourself. (If you are an admin who is tasked with installing the Viva Insights app for an organization, see [Admin tasks: Quick-start guide](#admin-tasks-quick-start-guide).)

## Admin tasks: Quick-start guide

[Teams Service Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles#teams-roles-and-capabilities) can choose to deploy and pin the app for all users or particular departments [through custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies). 

Complete the steps in the following mini-playbooks to get the Viva Insights app up and running for people in your organization. 

1. Turn on the Viva Insights app for your organization: 
[Release the Insights app within your organization](Release-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

   > [!Note] 
   > To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Insights, do the following: 
   > 
   > 1. Make sure that Viva Insights is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps) page. 
   > 
   > 2. Create a custom-app permission policy and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps) policies in Teams. 

2. Install the Viva Insights app for all employees in your organization: [Install the Insights app](Install-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

3. Pin the Insights app to the left navigation pane of Teams for all employees in your organization: [Pin the Insights app](Pin-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

4. Now that the Insights app is available for employees, they can follow these steps to locate and open it: [Find and open the Insights app](Find-and-open-the-Insights-app.pdf). 
   
   > [!Important] 
   > The following step is required for managers. It gives them access to the My Team page of the Viva Insights app. 

5.	Grant access to managers. To do this, follow the steps in [To configure manager settings](settings.md#to-configure-manager-settings). You can make this setting either for all or for a subset of managers in the organization.  

## Use the My Team page

The My Team page in the Microsoft Viva insights app shows the following outcomes:
 * Organizational resiliency
 * Employee engagement
 * Improve agility
 * Foster innovation
 * Effective managers
 * Operational effectiveness
 * Accelerate change
 * Transform meeting culture
 * Increase customer focus

![Four outcomes on the page](../images/wpa/use/my-org-page-70.png)

To use the My Team page, view the outcomes and decide which might warrant action on your part. Look at the leading indicators; do you see any red flags? 

### Drill down to the insights level

To investigate further, drill down by selecting one of the outcomes to see the insights for that outcome. For example, select the **Effective managers** outcome to see the **Develop effective managers** insights:

![Develop effective managers](../images/wpa/use/dev-effect-managers.png)

Similarly, you can select **Boost employee engagement** on the Outcomes page to see the **Boost employee engagement** insights:

![Boost employee engagement](../images/wpa/use/teams-app-boost-empl-engag-70.png)

### Drill down to the best-practices level

To learn about taking action on an outcome, you can drill down another layer to see related best practices. For example, on the **Boost employee engagement** insight, select **View best practices**. This opens the panel called, **Best Practices: Increase frequency of coaching**:

![Best practice - Coaching frequency](../images/wpa/use/teams-bestprac-freq-coaching-70.png)

## Compare with Workplace Analytics insights

The Viva Insights app shows you outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Workplace Analytics also shows outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Here's how the two apps compare: 

#### Similar functionality

* In both Viva Insights and in Workplace Analytics, you see outcomes on the initial page. You drill down by selecting an outcome to see its insights. You can drill down further by selecting an insight to see what best practices are recommended for it. 

#### Different functionality 

* In Workplace Analytics, the best practices pages offer additional action links that you can select, such as **Explore the stats**, **Explore in Power BI**, and **Plans**. 

For example, in Workplace Analytics, by selecting **Increase frequency of coaching** on the page of the **Boost employee engagement** outcome, you see the best practices for the **Increase frequency of coaching** insight:

![WpA best practice - increase frequency](../images/wpa/use/wpa-boost-best-prac-70.png)

Here is the same best practice in Viva Insights:

![Teams best practice - increase frequency](../images/wpa/use/teams-bestprac-freq-coaching-70.png)

You'll notice that the following section does not appear in the best practices page in Teams: 

![in WpA but not in Teams](../images/wpa/use/in-wpa-not-teams.png)

This section offers an **Explore the stats** link. To be able to explore these stats, you need to open this best practice in Workplace Analytics, not in Insights. 

### Feature descriptions

These outcomes, insights, and best practices are described in the Workplace Analytics documentation. As you browse this documentation, bear in mind the differences that are described in [Different functionality](#different-functionality).

 * [Enhance organizational resiliency](resilient-organizations.md)
 * [Boost employee engagement](boost-engagement.md)
