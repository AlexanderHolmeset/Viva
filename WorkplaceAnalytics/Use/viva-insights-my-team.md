# Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams - My Team

Manager insights provide visibility into team collaboration patterns that are leading indicators for overall employee experience and wellbeing. Manager insights can be viewed on the My Team page of the Microsoft Viva Insights app. 

![Outcomes page](../images/wpa/use/viva-team-outcomes.png)

While you can also see these outcome-based insights and their related best practices in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them in Teams, the tool that you're already using for communicating during remote work, the tool you use for meeting, sharing files, and sending IMs to employees and other leaders. 

#### Personal insights are also available

In addition to information about your team, the Viva Insights app also offers you [personal insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app), insights that can help any employee with their daily work:
 * **Stay connected** – This insight helps you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues through features such as AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. For more information about the Stay connected feature, see [Stay connected](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#stay-connected).  
 * **Protect time** – This insight helps you find more time to eliminate distractions, stop multi-tasking, and focus on your core priorities. For more information about Protect time feature, see [Protect time](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/teams-app#protect-time-tab).

## Data privacy 

For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in the Viva Insights app, see [Privacy and data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/privacy/data-protection-intro). 

## Prerequisites

* **Manager access** - Confirm that the Workplace Analytics admin has set to "on" the manager setting that enables managers to see Team insights. Admins make this setting in Workplace Analytics in the [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).
* **Licensed team** - The members of your team must have been assigned Workplace Analytics licenses and they must also be included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager. 
* **Minimum team size** - Your team structure must meet the minimum group size of 10 or more measured and licensed employees.

## Admin tasks: Deployment

[Teams Service Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles#teams-roles-and-capabilities) can choose to deploy and pin the app for all users or particular departments [through custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies). 

Complete the steps in the following mini-playbooks to get the Viva Insights app up and running for people in your organization. 

1. Turn on the Viva Insights app for your organization: 
[Release the Insights app within your organization](../myanalytics/use/release-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

   > [!Note] 
   > To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Insights, do the following: 
   > 
   > 1. Make sure that Viva Insights is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps) page. 
   > 
   > 2. Create a custom-app permission policy and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps) policies in Teams. 

2. Install the Viva Insights app for all employees in your organization: [Install the Insights app](../myanalytics/use/install-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

3. Pin the Insights app to the left navigation pane of Teams for all employees in your organization: [Pin the Insights app](../myanalytics/use/pin-the-Insights-app.pdf). 

4. Now that the Insights app is available for employees, they can follow these steps to locate and open it: [Find and open the Insights app](../myanalytics/use/find-and-open-the-Insights-app.pdf). 
   
   > [!Important] 
   > The following step is required for managers. It gives them access to the My Team page of the Viva Insights app. 

5.	Grant access to manager insights. To do this, an admin follows the steps in [To configure manager settings](manager-settings.md#to-configure-manager-settings). They can make this setting either for all or for a subset of managers in the organization.  

## Use the My Team page

The My Team page in the Microsoft Viva insights app shows the following outcomes:
 * Employee experience
 * Team effectiveness

![Two outcomes on the Outcomes page](../images/wpa/use/viva-team-outcomes.png)

To use the My Team page, view the outcomes and decide which might warrant action on your part. Look at the leading indicators; do you see any red flags? 

### Drill down to the insights level

To investigate further, select one of the outcomes to see the insights for that outcome. For example, select the **Employee experience** outcome to see the **Coaching and development** insights:

![Coaching and development](../images/wpa/use/viva-team-drill-down.png)

### Drill down to the best-practices level

To learn about taking action on an outcome, you can drill down another layer to see related best practices. For example, on the **Boost employee engagement** insight, select **View best practices**, which opens the panel called, **Best Practices: Increase frequency of coaching**:

![Best practice - Coaching frequency](../images/wpa/use/viva-team-coaching-flyout.png)

## Viva Insights and Workplace Analytics

The Viva Insights app shows you outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Workplace Analytics also shows outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and best practices for each insight. Here's how the two apps compare: 

#### Similar functionality

* In both Viva Insights and in Workplace Analytics, you see outcomes on the initial page. You drill down by selecting an outcome to see its insights. You can drill down further by selecting an insight to see what best practices are recommended for it. 

#### Different functionality 

* In Workplace Analytics, you have the additional capability to launch plans from the wellbeing, collaboration and focus-plan insights.

* Best practices are integrated into the flow of the Viva Insights app, but in Workplace Analytics, best practices are presented in documentation. 

### Feature descriptions

These outcomes, insights, and best practices are described in the Workplace Analytics documentation. As you browse this documentation, bear in mind the differences that are described in [Different functionality](#different-functionality).

> [!Note] 
> As you use the Viva insights app, you can provide feedback about the app to Microsoft. To learn how, see Q2 in the following section, [How can I send feedback to Microsoft about the Insights app?](#q2-how-can-i-send-feedback-to-microsoft-about-the-insights-app)
