# Insights in Outlook

> [!Note] 
> Exciting news! The Insights Outlook add-in is becoming broadly available for Office 365 users. This describes the new capabilities that users will get.

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.
