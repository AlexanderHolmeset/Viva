# Workspace planning

You can use the Workspace planning tool to generate floor plans quickly and objectively, in a data-driven way that optimizes employee collaboration by seating teams together who collaborate intensively.  

You can create seating plans that require different variables. For example:

* Co-locate teams who intensively collaborate in a building with multiple floors and zones or neighborhoods.
* Cross-team collaboration around constraints for specific teams, such as HR must be on the first floor or Zone A needs to be next to the file room.
* Create alternating shift schedules that optimize for week or day shifts and for cross-team collaboration.
