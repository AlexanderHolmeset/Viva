* **Analyst** - Has full access to all service features except two pages (**Upload** and **Admin settings**) that are meant only for admins. The **Analyst** role provides analysts with the most complete access to data.

* **Analyst (Limited Access)** - Same access as for those in the **Analyst** role but with the following restrictions:
   * No access to **Queries**.
   * Only _read-only_ access to the **Analysis settings** page (on which meeting exclusion rules are defined).

* **Administrator** - Has access to the **Settings** menu and through it the **Data sources**, **Upload**, and **Admin settings** pages. The Workplace Analytics admin has the responsibility to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to prepare, upload, and verify organizational data.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Workplace Analytics admins are not Office 365 admins. Therefore, unless they have *also* been granted the role of Office 365 administrator, they have access only to organizational data, not to Office 365 data.

* **Program manager** - Has access to the **Home** page of Workplace Analytics. Program managers also can open the **Plans** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up plans; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the progress of active plans and the state of ended plans.

* **Group manager** - If the team meets the minimum team size set by the admin, their manager has access to only their team's insights on the **Home** page in Workplace Analytics. A team includes the group manager and the employees who directly or indirectly report to that manager within the organization's reporting hierarchy. Group managers can also see the **Plans** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up plans; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the progress of active plans and the state of ended plans.
