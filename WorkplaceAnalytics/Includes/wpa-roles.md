* **Analyst** &ndash; Has full access to all service features except two pages (**Upload** and **Admin settings**) that are meant only for admins. The **Analyst** role provides analysts with the most complete access to data. This includes the ability to launch, manage, and track plans.

* **Analyst (Limited Access)** &ndash; Has the same access as people who have the **Analyst** role but with the following restrictions:
   * No access to **Queries**.
   * Only _read-only_ access to the **Analysis settings** page (on which [meeting and attendee exclusion rules](../tutorials/exclusions-introduction.md) are defined).

* **Administrator** &ndash; Has access to the **Settings** menu and through it the **Data sources**, **Upload**, and **Admin settings** pages. The Workplace Analytics admin has the responsibility to configure privacy settings and system defaults and to prepare, upload, and verify organizational data.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Workplace Analytics admins are not Microsoft 365 admins. Therefore, unless they have *also* been granted the role of Microsoft 365 administrator, they have access only to organizational data, not to Microsoft 365 data.

* **Program Manager** &ndash; Has access to the **Home** page of Workplace Analytics. Program managers also can open the **Plans** page and its **Manage** page, where they can set up plans; and to the **Track** page, where they can track the progress of active plans and the state of ended plans.

>[!Note]
>The People Manager role is not assigned like the other roles are assigned. Workplace Analytics admins grant this role to managers on the **Admin settings** > [**Manager settings**](../use/manager-settings.md) page in Workplace Analytics.
