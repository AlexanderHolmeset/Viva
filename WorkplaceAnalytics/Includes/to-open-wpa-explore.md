**To open the Workplace Analytics Explore page** 

1. Open [Workplace Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com). If prompted, enter your work credentials.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Explore**.
3. In Explore, select **External collaboration**.

External collaboration shows various graphs that reflect current company data. You can focus your analysis by manipulating these graphs and pivoting on various parameters. Each graph also offers filtering options.

   >[!Note]
   >You must be assigned either the Analyst role, the Analyst (Limited Access) role, or the Program manager role to access the Explore page. For details, see [Assign roles to Workplace Analytics admins and analysts](../setup/set-up-workplace-analytics.md#step-3-assign-roles-to-workplace-analytics-admins-and-analysts).
