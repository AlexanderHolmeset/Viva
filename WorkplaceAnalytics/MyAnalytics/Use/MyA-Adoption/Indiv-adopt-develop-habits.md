# Build your habit

After you have completed the [Diagnose your problem](Indiv-adopt-diagnose.md) and [Set your goal](Indiv-adopt-set-goals.md) steps, you will have the following elements for your behavior change plan: your purpose for change, your behavior-change objective, and your specific and measurable goal. The missing piece is a behavior to achieve your goal and turn into a habit.

Any number of behaviors can support a goal and turn into a habit. For example, if your goal is to reduce your meeting hours by 50%, you could achieve that goal by doing the following:

 1. Say no to meetings that donâ€™t include an agenda.
 2. Avoid meetings during which you multitask.
 3. Divide and conquer meetings you share with a coworker. 

We recommend that you start by selecting one or two behaviors to keep things simple and to more easily determine which one works best for you. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions to collaboration problems. The next section explains how you can use Learning modules, Habit playbooks, and the Habit-building method to turn new behaviors into solid habits based on behavioral science.
