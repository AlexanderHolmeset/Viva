# Set your goal

## Define your purpose 

After you gain more clarity on your collaboration problem and before you set your specific MyAnalytics goal, take some time to reflect on and clearly articulate why you might want to change your behaviors. Articulating these reasons can strengthen your motivation. 

People aim to align their actions with their beliefs. If you donâ€™t fully believe in the underlying reasons for change, it will be more difficult to maintain new habits. Try answering the following questions to define your purpose for change:

 * Why is it important for me to change?
 * How exactly will things be better for me if I change?
 * How will this change make me a better teammate and/or manager?
 * What are the risks of not changing?

## Define your measurable goal 

After you have clearly defined your purpose for change, diagnosed your collaboration problem, and selected your behavior-change objective, you are ready to set your specific MyAnalytics goal. To start, find the related metric in your dashboard, figure out how much time you usually spend on the thing you want to change, and write it down, along with your desired target. Each week, you can check your dashboard to see how you compare to your goal. For more information on how to create a plan for achieving your goal, see [Habit-building method](Adopt-Habit-building-method.md).

MyAnalytics encourages you to set goals directly in your dashboard, which will allow you to keep track of your progress week over week:

You can also set your own goal using other MyAnalytics metrics. To start, find the related metric in your dashboard, figure out how much time you usually spend on the thing you want to change, and write it down, along with your desired target. Each week, you can check your dashboard to see how you compare to your goal. For more information on how to create a plan for achieving your goal, see [Habit-building method](Adopt-Habit-building-method.md).

The following table provides some common examples of behavior-change objectives, related metrics in MyAnalytics, and examples of goals that align to those objectives.
