# MyAnalytics email digests

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

As a MyAnalytics user, you'll receive a weekly email digest with suggestions to help you better understand your work patterns and ways to improve them.

Each week will focus on one of the following work patterns:

* **Focus** - Find ways to increase your focus hours, so you can accomplish deep work and unleash your creativity.
* **Wellbeing** - See if you’re getting good balance between work and personal time, then find ways to disconnect and unwind after hours.
* **Network** - See who’s in your network and make sure you’re keeping up with important contacts and relationships.
* **Collaboration** - Get tips on how to plan your calendar, spend less time in low-quality meetings, and write more effective emails.

## Opt out of email digests

If you do not want to receive digest emails from MyAnalytics, you can opt out of them:

1. Open your [MyAnalytics dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon at the top right.
3. Under **MyAnalytics**, select **Settings**.
4. Under **Email digest**, change the setting to **Off**.
5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

### If I am opted out, can I opt back in?

Yes; if you opt yourself out or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to the email digest.
