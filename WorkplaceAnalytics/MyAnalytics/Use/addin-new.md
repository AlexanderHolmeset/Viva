# Insights Outlook add-in

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum? 
If your answer to any of these questions is yes, the Outlook add-in provides insights that you can act upon to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done. This add-in is an extension of your Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you be more focused at work, maintain your work relationships, enhance your collaboration, and improve your overall work-life balance. 

## Privacy by Design

The Outlook add-in preserves all the data-subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights you see in the add-in are only available to you, see Privacy FAQ for details. No admin or manager can see these insights. They are computed as needed, from your email and meeting information, and are never stored outside your mailbox. Additionally, the add-in begins processing data for insights only after the first time you open it. Learn more about how Microsoft protects your privacy.

## Open the Insights Add-in

**Prerequisites:** Turn the Outlook Reading pane on and select an email item.

### Windows Outlook Desktop

### Outlook on the Web
 * Open an email message, select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right corner of your email message, and then select Insights. You can pin the Add-in to your quick access pane for easier access. See Pin the add-in for details.

### Mac Outlook Desktop

Meetings are vital for healthy collaboration. Better meeting practices can improve productivity, information sharing, innovation, decision-making, and connections among team members. Read more about best practices for running effective meetings in the [Meetings playbook](https://opdhsblobprod03.blob.core.windows.net/contents/c061aa4c5f284dcfb016c4d96b230182/95fb77fe28fe39b17203a7456d0dd375?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&si=ReadPolicy&sig=Zu8S0o%2BegwIxEDwiboGWuU28wbgR0k8QUbJ9C173EcM%3D&st=2020-05-18T15%3A39%3A07Z&se=2020-05-19T15%3A49%3A07Z).

## Track email open rates

_**Applies to**: MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is.md)_

Emails are the backbone of work communications. Better email communication can improve productivity and information sharing and speed up decision-making. This insight gives you feedback on how well your sent emails are received. 

The **Track email open rates** card can tell you how many people have opened your email and the average time they spent reading that email. This information can help you follow up with recipients if needed and/or tailor your communication style to get the job done. MyAnalytics respects user privacy; this is why: 

 * Not all emails are eligible (For more information about eligible sent emails, see [Eligibility Criterion]())
 * Approximated values are reported, and 
 * Individual recipient information is never shown. 
For more information about privacy, see [Email read rates](). If you need individual recipient information, learn about [request read receipts]() in Outlook.

#### To use this card

 * On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Track email open rates** card. This card provides read statistics of the eligible emails that you sent in the last 14 days:

    ![Track email open rates](../../images/mya/use/step-1-track-open-rates.png)
 
   If you are already have a sent email open, the Insights panel will show you read statistics at the top of the panel, as shown here:

    ![Track email open rates](../../images/mya/use/test-email-read-stats.png)   

   If you do not have an email open, select the **Track email open rates** card to see read statistics for all eligible sent emails.
 
#### Insight option details

| Card section | Notes | Recommendations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Email Subject 	|Shows the email title|	
|Open Rate	|This is the proportion of the email recipients who opened your email in Outlook.<br>For more information about these statistics, see [Open rate](). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Depending on the importance of the email and overall open rate, you might want to follow up with the recipients. |
| Open rate summary | Brief summary of the overall readership. |	
| Forwards | The number of times the email was forwarded. | 	
| Average time spent on email | The average amount of time spent on the email by people who opened it. | If you think emails are not being read or readers are not spending enough time reading, it could be because the email is too long or the content could be better organized, for example, to first call out highlights. | 

### Open rate

The Insights add-in reports the open rate within 30 minutes of when a qualifying email was sent by you, as per the following table. Note the following:

* For open rates lower than the minimum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 20% of 10 email recipients open the email, Insights displays the open rate as < 25%.
* If the actual open rate falls between the "Minimum" and "Maximum" values shown in the table, then the actual open rate is reported.
* For open rates higher than the maximum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 98% of the email recipients open the email, the maximum value in the table will be > 95%. [[FIX WORDING IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE!]]

| Number of recipients | Open rate reported | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| 5 - 10 |	Minimum: 25% <br> Maximum: 75% |
| 11 - 20 |	Minimum: 10% <br> Maximum: 90% |
| > 21 |	Minimum: 5% <br> Maximum: 95% |

### Eligibility Criterion
Insights does not display read information about every email that you send.

<u>Requirement: qualifying messages</u>

Read statistics are shown only for qualifying messages. A qualifying message is an email message that is sent to five or more qualifying recipients. A qualifying recipient is a person who is in the same company as the sender and has a cloud mailbox. Distribution lists are expanded before counting qualifying recipients. 

After you send an email message, it can take up to 30 minutes before Insights informs you about it. If the email is sent from a delegated mailbox with "send on behalf" permission, the delegate can see the read statistics.

<u>Exceptions to qualifying messages</u>

Insights does not report about email messages in the following categories:

* Email that was sent from a shared mailbox
* Email that was sent more than 14 days ago.
* Email in which the total number of recipients (the sum of all of the recipients in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields) is less than five.
iv)
* Email sent to modern groups. (If users are following the modern group, they are included in the count.)

## View Outstanding Tasks

It is easy to lose track of your tasks and commitments to your colleagues over email. The View outstanding tasks card can help you make sure nothing falls through the cracks by reminding you of tasks that you've agreed to do, based on your sent mails and requests from your colleagues during the last 14 days of email communication. For example:

 * "I will send you the latest report tomorrow"
 * "Will get back to you by end of the week with a suitable meeting time"
 * A colleague asked you three days ago: "Please review this deck by the end of the week"

Add to To Do Actions	Clicking on this will add the task to Microsoft To Do so that you can catch up later. 
Consider breaking tasks down into simple steps, add due dates, and set reminders to keep you on track. Further, a MS To Do list can help effectively prioritize and even delegate work leading to higher productivity

## Follow up on your requests

It can be easy to lose track of the requests you make to your colleagues once they are sent. By automatically extracting your outstanding follow ups from the last 14 days of email communication, the “Follow up on your requests” card can help you check in on requests to your colleagues. For example:

"Can you send me this year's latest report?"
"Everyone, please complete your performance evaluations by the end of the week."
"Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch scheduled early next week."

#### To use this card

 * In the Insights panel, select the Follow up on your requests card. This card is only available in English.

## Book time to focus

Research shows that on average it takes 23 minutes to refocus on a task after a distraction, and constant distraction during focused work can cause higher stress, lower productivity, and bad mood. Further, it can be hard to go deep on challenging work if you only have small chunks of time to focus between meetings or are easily distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help you make progress on your important tasks and projects.

The Book time to focus card can help you protect time for focused work and also minimize notifications (and thus distraction) by Teams and Skype for business chats and calls during your focus time. 

#### To use this card

 * In the Insights panel, select the Book time to focus card. This card appears if you have time available on your calendar during your working hours which is not blocked by meetings or appointments. 
 
This opens a panel that displays all the time available to focus in the coming week, with a couple of available slots every day. With one click you can add focus time to your calendar and get ready for distraction-free deep work. You can also book all available time for focused work with one click, thus setting you up for focused work over a longer duration.
  

Here are details of the assistance that this card can provide:

Card section	Notes
Date/Time	Shows the date and time of the available focus time that you can book.
+ 	Select this to add time to your calendar as focus time.
Pencil icon	Say you want to focus on “Sales pitch” for two hours. Select the pencil icon, change the “Focus time” label to “Sales pitch,” and then click (+). This books a two-hour appointment on your calendar with title “Sales pitch.” 

You can set priority contacts in Teams to ensure that you don’t miss important messages during focus time.
Book all	This books all available focus time at once, setting you up for enough protected time for deep work throughout the week.

Use Set lunch hours to set your lunch hour preferences. MyAnalytics will respect your preferences when it proposes focus time.
Catch up on email
It is easy for important emails to get lost when your inbox is full of unread emails. We all could use some help with identifying important unread emails. With the Catch up on email card you can cut through the clutter with a summary of the most important unread email.
To use this card
•	In the Insights panel, select the Catch up on email card which captures your important unread email based on last 14 days of email communication.
 
This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your important unread emails:
 
Here are details of the insight and assistance the card can provide
Card section	Notes
Name and Icon	Sender of the email
Email subject line	Subject line preview of the email
Email snapshot	A snapshot of the text related to the email
Open 	Select this to open the relevant email for your review. 

Triaging through your important unread emails first can help you get to your important workflows faster.

## Catch up on documents

Searching for that document you had planned to read but can’t find anymore? With so many documents shared across meetings and emails, it can be difficult to stay caught up on documents shared by your colleagues. With the Catch up on documents card you can see a list of the shared OneDrive and SharePoint documents in email that you need to catch up on.

#### To use this card

1.	In the Insights panel, select the  Catch up on documents card. 
 
This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each document shared with you in the last 14 days that you have not yet opened.

Open Email	Select this to open the related email for your review.

Book time	Select this to expand the card with option to book time on your calendar to review the document.

## Add important people

On a regular day, you might have unread emails and outstanding tasks from many people but some people might be more important than others. For example, an outstanding task from your manager or a message from a key customer might be of higher priority. Based on your collaboration patterns, Add important people can suggest that you mark some of your contacts as important; afterwards, MyAnalytics will remind you when you have tasks to do for these important people or unread email from them.

#### To use this card

1.	In the Insights panel, select the  Add important people card:

 

This opens a panel with suggestions to mark a recommended contact as important:

 

Here are details of the insight and assistance that the card can provide:

## Set lunch hours

Struggling to protect time for lunch? Colleagues keep sending meeting invites during your lunch hours? Not taking a lunch break can leave you feeling more tired and stressed and less focused. Even if you just take 15-20 minutes, this is a proven way to keep your levels of concentration and energy up during your day. Set lunch hours card to protect your lunch hours and personalize your MyAnalytics insights to take into account your preferred lunch hours.

#### To use this card

 * In the Insights panel, locate Set lunch hours:
 

Here are details of the insight and assistance that the card can provide:

Confirm	This will confirm your lunch hour settings. MyAnalytics will then exclude lunch hours when recommending focus blocks or meeting times.	Taking care of your mental and physical wellbeing. Studies show that taking a lunch break allows your mind to rest, recharge and refocus, which can directly improve your productivity for the rest of the day.

Add a recurring calendar event	By checking this box, you have the option to add a recurring calendar event to protect this time.	Consider setting a recurring calendar event if your preferred lunch hours frequently conflict with meetings.

## Meeting suggestions

Staying in touch with your top collaborators can be difficult. A quick 1:1 meeting with your key contacts can help you nurture our professional network.  Meeting suggestion card can keep track of your collaboration pattern and provide meeting recommendation if case you are falling out of touch. For example, if you have not had 1:1 meeting with your manager in a while, this card can suggest setting up a 1:1 and even assist with scheduling the meeting.

#### To use this card

 * In the Insights panel, locate the **Meet with &lt;name of contact&gt;** card. 

Here are details of the insight and assistance that the card can provide:

Card section	Notes	Recommendations
Name and Icon	A person you collaborate with regularly but have not had a 1:1 meeting in a while.	
Schedule meeting	Select this to open a meeting form which you can quickly complete to set up a meeting.	Regular 1:1s with your top collaborators can help you improve productivity and grow your network.

## Check quiet hours impact

Studies shows that the expectation to respond to email outside of working hours results in anxiety and impacts the health of employees and their families. In fact, the mere expectation of availability outside of working hours can increase strain for your colleagues, even when they do not engage in actual work outside of working hours.

With the **Check quiet hours impact** card, you can help your team achieve work-life balance by reviewing emails your co-workers responded to outside of working hours.

#### To use this card

 * In the Insights panel, select Check quiet hours impact:
 
This opens a panel that displays insights around the emails which might have impacted co-workers outside of their working hours:
