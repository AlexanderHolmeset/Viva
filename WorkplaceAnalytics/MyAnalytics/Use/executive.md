# Executive insights

This dashboard helps executives who spend majority of their time in meetings understand their time allocation across priorities. Before you use the Executive dashboard, you or an assistant should use color to categorize your meetings in Microsoft Outlook. The dashboard will then use these categores to present deeper information about your meetings in tables and charts.


The Executive insights help you reflect on how effectively you spend your time in meetings.

## Meeting trends

The Meeting habits section highlights what your habits or practices are in meetings you organized and accepted. You can switch between the Habits view and the List view:

* The **Meeting habits** view shows data about your meeting habits based on the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks. It helps you understand the number of times each of these meeting types occur out of the total number of meetings you organized or accepted to attend.

## Configure Executive insights

You can configure the views by using the following controls: 

### Select time frame

Select a value from the choices **Last 4 weeks**, **Last 3 months**, or **Last 4 quarters**. This determines the time frame about which the rest of the page will show information.

### Select meeting categories

 * Select **Top meeting categories** to include ... 
 * Select **Not categorized** to include data from all of your meetings. 

### Meeting view and trend view
