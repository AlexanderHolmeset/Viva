# Executive insights

As an executive, your time is your key asset, and meetings are an important factor in your time management. You need to understand how your time is being spent within and outside your organization. The Executive dashboard provides a birdâ€™s eye view of your time allocation both to you and to an assistant who has delegate access to your Outlook calendar.

The purpose of the Executive insights dashboard is time management, which is your primary tool for staying focused on your many and various commitments. 

This dashboard shows you your time spent in meetings by category and lets you dive deeper into categories of your choice. By associating each meeting category with a priority, you can determine whether you've been spending the right time across your various priorities. You can view this data over varying periods of time, up to one year in the past.

Before you use the Executive dashboard, you or an assistant should categorize your meetings in Microsoft Outlook. The dashboard can then use these categories to present relevant information about your meetings in tables and charts.

### Access to the Executive dashboard

Access to the dashboad is based on either of two things: executive status as determined by the organizational hierarchy, or possession of delegate access to an executive's mailbox. 

#### Executives and senior leadership

Who is an executive who can use this dashboard? Based on analysis of Azure Active Directory records, an executive is someone who has a reporting structure of least 200 employees and is above at least two levels of managers.

#### Delegate access

Delegate access is typically granted to an executive admin or chief of staff (CoS), but for the purposes of this dashboard, it can be any person who has been granted [delegate access](https://support.microsoft.com/office/allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926) to the executive's Outlook calendar.

### Meeting trends

The Meeting habits section highlights what your habits or practices are in meetings you organized and accepted. You can switch between the Habits view and the List view:

* The **Meeting habits** view shows data about your meeting habits based on the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks. It helps you understand the number of times each of these meeting types occur out of the total number of meetings you organized or accepted to attend.

## Monthly digest email

If you are an executive, the monthly digest email includes a section that provides a preview of the insights that your Executive dashboard will show. For easy access, this email offers a link to the dashboard. 

If you are a person with delegate access, the monthly digest email includes not only your own content, but an additional section for each executive for whom you have delegate access. These executive sections duplicate the insights that the executive sees in their monthly digest email.

## Configure Executive insights

### Configure meetings

The Executive dashboard works best if the executive or an assistant has already [categorized the executive's meetings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/assign-a-color-category-to-a-calendar-appointment-meeting-or-event-750596d9-707d-4412-8c0e-7fdc0fc52527) in Outlook.
