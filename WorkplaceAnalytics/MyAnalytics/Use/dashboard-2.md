> [!Note]
> Only you can see your data, see [Privacy FAQ](../overview/mya-faq.md#privacy) for details. 

## Home

The MyAnalytics dashboard opens to the **Home** page that shows you statistics about your work patterns over the past month, including your focus and collaboration time, how many days you were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively you are networking with your coworkers.

## Focus and Wellbeing

The Focus section helps you understand whether you have enough time for uninterrupted individual work and provides tips on how to protect your calendar and manage distractions.

The Wellbeing section shows how well you are disconnecting from work during your time off and suggests ways to reduce stress and burnout.

For more details and tips, see [Focus](../use/focus.md) and [Wellbeing](../use/wellbeing.md).

> [!Tip] 
> The _focus plan_ in MyAnalytics helps you set aside regular focus time for your top-priority work. This plan helps you schedule one to two hours every day to focus, with an option to book that time automatically. During the booked focus time, it silences chats in Teams and in Skype for Business. For more information, see [MyAnalytics focus plan](focus-plan.md).  

## Network and Collaboration

The Network section shows information about your relationships with the people in your network, which is based on your work activities over the past year.

The Collaboration section shows the people you actively collaborated with based on your work activities over the past month, such as email, chats, calls, and meetings.

For more details and tips, see [Network](../use/network.md) and [Collaboration](../use/collaboration.md).

## Productivity insights

These are based on your recent workplace activity. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas about how you might change or improve your current work patterns.
