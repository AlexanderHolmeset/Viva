# Insights Outlook add-in

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.

This add-in is an extension of your Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you gain focus time, maintain your work relationships, plan time away from work, and improve your overall work-life balance.

## To add tasks to your focus time

1.    In Outlook, select **Insights**.

2.    In the Insights panel, select the **View outstanding tasks** card. This opens the **SUGGESTED TASKS** panel.

3.    On a card for which you want to add a task, select the ellipsis. This opens a menu with three options:

     * If you select **Book time to review**, Outlook finds new upcoming 30-minute slots in your calendar and proposes them to you. 

       Then, select the plus sign to add this task to your calendar for the displayed time period. Outlook will book this as additional focus time and mark your status during this period as "Do not disturb." In your calendar, this time is labeled "Focus time (tasks included)."

     * If you already have focus time booked, you can select **Add to focus time**. Outlook then finds existing focus time periods in your calendar and proposes them to you. 

       Select **Add** to add this task to the already scheduled focus time block on your calendar.  
     * If you select **This isn't a task**, Outlook removes the card from the **SUGGESTED TASKS** panel.
