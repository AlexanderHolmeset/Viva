# Insights Outlook add-in

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides insights that you can act upon to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done. This add-in is an extension of your Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you gain focus time, maintain your work relationships, plan time away from work, and improve your overall work-life balance.

## Why don't I see the Outlook Insights add-in?

Before you can use the Insights add-in, be sure that the following prerequisites are in place:

* Have a MyAnalytics user license and let at least 24 hours elapse since you were granted that license.
* Have a valid mailbox. This cannot be a shared mailbox or even a shared mailbox that was converted into a user mailbox. It must be a user mailbox from the start. We recommended that you [provision a new user mailbox](/exchange/recipients/create-user-mailboxes?preserve-view=true&view=exchserver-2019#create-user-mailboxes), if necessary.
* Have the following in place:

  * Your computer has Outlook version 1705 (build 8201.2102) or higher for Windows, or version 15.39.1010 or later for Mac.
  * Add-in commands are enabled for the Outlook add-in. For details, see [Add-in commands for Outlook](/outlook/add-ins/add-in-commands-for-outlook).
  * Internet Explorer version 10 or 11 is installed on your computer.  

>[!Note]
>The Outlook Insights add-in is not available on mobile devices. 

Open the Insights add-in in one of the programs listed under [Open the Insights add-in](#open-the-insights-add-in), namely [Windows Outlook desktop](#windows-outlook-desktop), [Outlook on the web](#outlook-on-the-web), or [Mac Outlook desktop](#mac-outlook-desktop).
* Select an email. In Outlook, you can do this in one of the following ways:

  * Open the email in a new window.
  * With the [Outlook Reading Pane](https://support.office.com/article/use-and-configure-the-reading-pane-to-preview-messages-2fd687ed-7fc4-4ae3-8eab-9f9b8c6d53f0) open, view the email in the Reading Pane.
