# Insights Outlook add-in

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.

This add-in is an extension of your Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you gain focus time, maintain your work relationships, plan time away from work, and improve your overall work-life balance.

## What you might see

After you [open the Insights add-in](#open-the-insights-add-in) in Outlook (or in Outlook on the web), you'll see a number of insights in the right pane. For example:

![Insights pane](../../images/mya/use/insights-cards-trunc-2.png)

The insights cards consist of the following:

 * **View outstanding tasks.** Make sure nothing falls through the cracks with reminders of tasks that you've agreed to get done.

 * **Add important people.** Manage your list of important contacts. You'll see reminders when you have tasks to do for these people or unread email from them.

 * **Check after-hours impact.** Help your team achieve work-life balance by reviewing the impact of sending email outside of working hours.

 * **Book time to focus.** Protect your calendar by reserving focus time before meetings take over.

 * **Catch up on email.** Cut through the clutter with a summary of unread email from your more important contacts.

 * **Catch up on documents.** See a list of the shared OneDrive and SharePoint documents in email that you need to catch up on.

 * **Prepare for your meetings.** Help better prepare for and then drive effective meetings.

 * **Follow up on your requests.** Make sure nothing falls through the cracks; you'll receive reminders to follow up on commitments made by your colleagues or requests made by you.

 * **Set lunch hours.** Use this card to protect your lunch hours and personalize your insights.

 * **Track email open rates.** Track readership of emails sent by you by viewing the percentage open rate, the percentage attachment click rate, and so on, for emails that you sent to five or more people.
