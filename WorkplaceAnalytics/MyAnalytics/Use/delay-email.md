# Delay delivery

When composing an email in Outlook, Delay delivery will show you suggestions to schedule email deliveries at a later time that aligns with the working hours of the recipients in their respective time zones. This helps minimize disruptions to recipients outside their working hours.

If you have inline suggestions turned on, you'll only see two delay delivery suggestions a day unless you also opt in to Delay delivery. If you opt in to Delay delivery, either through the  MyAnalytics dashboard or the Insights Outlook add-in, you'll get an unlimited number of inline suggestions for delaying email delivery when outside coworkers' working hours.

Delay delivery is currently only available to Microsoft or Office 365 E5, E3, and E1 users in the Outlook desktop app for Windows.
