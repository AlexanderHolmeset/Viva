# Opt out of MyAnalytics

All users can use the MyAnalytics dashboard to opt-out. When you opt out, the following will occur:

* You will no longer be able to access MyAnalytics, including your personal dashboard and [Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md).
* You will stop receiving [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) and the [weekly digest](../use/email-digest-2.md).
* Your email activity will not be included in other users' [email read statistics](../use/add-in.md#email-read-statistics).

## To opt out of MyAnalytics

1. Open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.
