# Opt out of MyAnalytics

All users can use the MyAnalytics dashboard to opt-out. When you opt out:

* You will no longer be able to access MyAnalytics, including your personal dashboard and [Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md).
* You will stop receiving [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) and [weekly digests](../use/email-digest-2.md).
* Your email activity will not be included in other users' [email open rates](../use/use-the-insights.md#track-email-and-document-open-rates).

## To opt out of MyAnalytics

1. Open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to a week for your saved changes to take effect.

### If you have multiple accounts

If you have more than one Microsoft 365 account, you might also have more than one subscription to MyAnalytics. In this situation, your steps to opt-out will differ.

With a subscription to MyAnalytics, you will most likely receive regular emails with subject lines such as "Focus edition" or "Wellbeing edition."  

**To opt out of multiple MyAnalytics accounts**

1. Determine which of your email accounts receive MyAnalytics emails. 
2. Open a web browser in incognito mode.
3. In the incognito browser session, open your [dashboard](myanalytics.microsoft.com). You will see a Microsoft **Sign in** dialog box. 
4. Sign in by using the credentials of an email account that reveives MyAnalytics emails.
5. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

6. Under **MyAnalytics**, select **Settings**.
7. For MyAnalytics, change the setting to **Off**.

8. Select **Save** to save your changes.
9. Repeat steps 2 - 8 for each account that receives MyAnalytics emails. 
 
## If I opt out, can I opt back in?

Yes, if you opt yourself out, or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to MyAnalytics.

To opt in, repeat the steps in the previous opt-out section, but in **Step 4**, change the setting to **On** for **MyAnalytics**.
