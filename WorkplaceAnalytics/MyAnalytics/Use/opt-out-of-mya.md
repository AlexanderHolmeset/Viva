# Opt out of MyAnalytics

All users can use the MyAnalytics dashboard to opt-out. When you opt out:

* You will no longer be able to access MyAnalytics, including your personal dashboard and [Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md).
* You will stop receiving [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) and [weekly digests](../use/email-digest-2.md).
* Your email activity will not be included in other users' [email read statistics](../use/add-in.md#email-read-statistics).

## To opt out of MyAnalytics

1. Open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to a week for your saved changes to take effect.

## If I opt out, can I opt back in?

Yes, if you opt yourself out, or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to MyAnalytics.

To opt in, repeat the steps in the previous opt-out section, but in **Step 4**, change the setting to **On** for **MyAnalytics**.
