# Opt out of MyAnalytics

All users can use the MyAnalytics dashboard to opt-out. When you opt out:

* You will no longer be able to access MyAnalytics, including your personal dashboard and [Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md).
* You will stop receiving [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) and [weekly digests](../use/email-digest-2.md).
* Your email activity will not be included in other users' [email open rates](../use/use-the-insights.md#track-email-and-document-open-rates).

## To opt out of MyAnalytics

1. Open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to a week for your saved changes to take effect.

### If you have multiple accounts

If you have more than one Microsoft 365 account, you might also have more than one subscription to MyAnalytics. You can decide which accounts to retain and which ones to opt out of.

Each email account that has a MyAnalytics subscription receives regular emails with subject lines such as "Focus edition" or "Wellbeing edition." To opt out of one or more of these subscriptions, first answer the following question:

* Which of my accounts receive emails from MyAnalytics subscriptions that I want to opt out of?

You will use the answer to this question in the following procedure:

**To opt out of multiple MyAnalytics accounts**

1. Open a web browser in incognito mode.
2. In the incognito browser session, open your [dashboard](myanalytics.microsoft.com). You'll see a Microsoft prompt to **Sign in**. 
3. Sign in by using the credentials of an email account whose  MyAnalytics subscription you want to end.
4. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the upper right.

5. Under **MyAnalytics**, select **Settings**.
6. For MyAnalytics, change the setting to **Off**.

7. Select **Save** to save your changes.
8. Repeat steps 1 - 7 for each account whose MyAnalytics subscription you want to opt out of. 
 
## If I opt out, can I opt back in?

Yes, if you opt yourself out, or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to MyAnalytics.

To opt in, repeat the steps in the previous opt-out section, but in **Step 4**, change the setting to **On** for **MyAnalytics**.
