# MyAnalytics manager assistant

The manager assistant feature of MyAnalytics helps managers stay caught up with their team members. To do this, MyAnalytics presents managers with opportunities to reconnect. For example: 

 * Schedule 1:1 time with direct reports 
 * Stay on top of tasks that your reports have requested
 * Read any unread emails or documents that they have sent and expect you to read

## Use the manager assistant

**Role:** manager in the organizational hierarchy

In this procedure, you are a manager who wants to connect better with your team members. You will use the manager assistant feature to discover that you have no 1:1 meetings on the calender with a particular employee, and to then set up one or more such meetings.  

1. On the **Home** ribbon of Microsoft Outlook, [open Insights](add-in#what-you-might-see). 

2. Select **Catch up with your team**:

3. The **Insights** pane shows team members with whom you can reconnect, and actions you can take to do so:

4. Take steps to follow up with this employee. For example, to schedule a 1:1 meeting with your report, Debra Berger, on her card select **See available times**. 

5. The **Insights** pane shows times that are free for both you and for this employee.

Choose a time that works for you and select **Draft invite**. A meeting invitation is drafted for you, which you can edit and send to your team member. 

6. (Optional) Follow up in other ways and with other employees. For example, your team member Pradeep has requested that you read four items -- emails or documents -- and you can find those items by selecting **Review** on the card for Pradeep, which is also visible in the **Insights** pane:
