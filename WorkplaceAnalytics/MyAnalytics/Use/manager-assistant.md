# MyAnalytics manager assistant

The manager assistant feature of MyAnalytics helps managers stay caught up with their team members. It does this by providing managers with easy ways to do the following:  

 * Schedule 1:1 time with a team member 
 * Stay on top of tasks that your team members have requested
 * Read any unread emails or documents that they have sent and expect you to read

## Use the manager assistant

**Role:** manager in an organizational hierarchy

In this procedure, you are a manager who wants to connect better with your team members. By using the manager assistant, you discover that you have no 1:1 meetings on the calender with a particular employee. You then use the screens of the feature to easily set up a meeting with that employee. 

1. On the **Home** ribbon of Microsoft Outlook, [open Insights](add-in#what-you-might-see). 

2. Select **Catch up with your team**:

   The **Insights** pane shows team members with whom you can reconnect and actions you can take to do so:

4. Take steps to follow up. To schedule a 1:1 meeting with your team member Debra Berger, on her card select **See available times**. 

   The **Insights** pane shows times that are free for both you and Debra.

5. Choose the time of your preference and select **Draft invite**. A meeting invitation is drafted for you, which you can edit and send to your team member. 

6. (Optional) Follow up in other ways and with other employees. For example, your team member Pradeep has requested that you read four items -- emails or documents. You can find and open those items by selecting **Review** on the card for Pradeep, which is also visible in the **Insights** pane:
