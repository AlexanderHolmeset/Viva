# MyAnalytics welcome email

Up to four weeks after an administrator assigns licenses with the MyAnalytics service to users, they receive a welcome email from MyAnalytics.

They do not receive this welcome email outside of their work week. For example, if necessary, its arrival time is delayed to a Monday to keep it from arriving on a weekend.  

The following is an example of a MyAnalytics welcome email.
