# Delay delivery plan

When you're composing an email in Outlook, Delay delivery will show you suggestions for scheduling email deliveries that align with the recipients' working hours in their respective time zones. The delay helps minimize disruptions to recipients outside their working hours. (Distribution lists and Microsoft 365/Office 365 groups do not count as qualifying recipients for use by the delay-delivery feature.)

With inline suggestions turned on, you can get up to two daily Delay delivery suggestions. To get more than two a day, you need to opt in to the Delay delivery plan.

You can opt in to the Delay delivery plan through MyAnalytics or the Insights Outlook add-in to get an unlimited number of inline suggestions for delaying email delivery to your coworkers. The Delay delivery plan is currently available to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 users within the Outlook desktop app for Windows. Be sure that you have Outlook for Windows 2016 version 1808 or greater and build 16.0.12016.10000 or greater.

<!-- CHANGE THIS SECOND-TO=LAST LAST SENTENCE TO THE FOLLOWING DURING H2 OF 2021. CONTACT TRACY ZHANG AND WENDY GUO TO CONFIRM. Delay delivery is currently available to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5, E3, and E1 users within the Outlook desktop app for Windows. -->

## Use Delay delivery

When composing email in Outlook, you can delay delivery of an email as follows:

1. When you see a suggested delivery time while composing an email, such as **Thu, Nov 07 10:00 AM** (as shown in the graphic), select **Delay send** to confirm message delivery at that time.

2. An insight opens to show the scheduled time. You can select:

   * **Send** (within the email) to send the email at that scheduled time.
   * **Edit time** (within the insight) to change the suggested delivery time, and then select **Send** (within the email) to send the email at the new time.
   * **Cancel delay** (within the insight) to cancel the scheduled delivery time, and then select **Send** (within the email) to send the email now.

3. After you send the email, it's kept in your Outlook **Sent items** folder until the scheduled delivery time, when it's automatically delivered for you.

   Before the message is sent, you can open the message and select:

   * **Send now** to ignore the scheduled delivery time and send the email now.
   * **Don't send** to stop the scheduled delivery time, which moves the email to your Outlook **Deleted items** folder.
