# Email 

### How we calculate email hours

Each email you send is assigned 5 minutes. Each email you open is assigned 2.5 minutes. However, shorter times are assigned in these cases:

* If you send one email and then open or send another one within 5 minutes, the time between the two actions gets assigned to the first email.
* If you open one email and then open or send another one within 2.5 minutes, the time between the two actions gets assigned to the first email.

### Which emails count?

The Email hours area shows an estimate of how much time you spent sending and reading emails. We consider your email use across all devices, such as laptops and mobile phones.

We include only emails that have your name, or a group you’re a member of, on the To: line or on the Cc: line. We don’t count emails that you delete without opening.

Also, any time that you spend reading or writing email outside your set work hours (as defined by your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance)) is included in
[After hours](MyA-DB-After-hours.md). This time is also included in your Email-hours total.
