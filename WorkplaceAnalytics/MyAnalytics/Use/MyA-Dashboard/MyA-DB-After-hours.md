# After hours 

### How we calculate after hours

Your after-hours time is the total time that you spent outside your work hours in any of the following activities:

 * Reading or writing email
 * Attending meetings whose invitations you've accepted
 * Participating in chats or calls in Teams or in Skype for Business 

For example, the time you spend reading or sending email messages on weekends counts as after-hours time.

#### Outlook settings define work hours

Your work hours are defined by your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance).

[!INCLUDE [Check your Outlook settings](../../Includes/to-check-your-outlook-settings.md)]

>[!Note] 
> * After hours is an estimate only and is not meant to reflect actual hours worked. You can compare how we calculate the times for [Meetings](MyA-DB-Meetings.md), for [Email](MyA-DB-Emails.md), and for [Chats and calls](MyA-DB-Chats-and-calls.md).
> * After-hours calls in Teams or in Skype for Business that form part of a scheduled meeting on your calendar count towards after-hours meetings. They do not count as after-hours chats or calls.
