# Meetings

### How we calculate meeting hours

Meeting hours consist of any meetings that you’ve organized or accepted that have at least one other person attending. Meeting hours include meetings that take place during your work hours and outside your work hours. After-hours meeting time also counts toward your after-hours total.

The following meeting types are also excluded from Meeting hours:

 * Meetings that last eight or more hours. This includes all-day meetings.
 * Meetings that are marked as Private.
 * Meetings with no other participants than yourself, for example when you block time in your calendar or set reminders.
 * Meetings for which Show As is set to any of the following values:

    * Free
    * Working Elsewhere
    * Tentative
    * Out of Office; see the following example:

> [!Note]
> MyAnalytics counts doubly booked meeting hours only once. For example, if you have two meetings that both run from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, MyAnalytics counts this as only one hour of meeting time.

## Meeting habits  

### How we categorize meetings

The Meeting habits section categorizes the meetings you’ve accepted and shows how much time you spent in each type of meeting. Meetings are categorized as follows: 

* **Conflicting meetings:** Meetings that overlap with other meetings that you've accepted, and where your status is set to Busy.
* **Longer meetings:** Meetings that last longer than an hour. 
* **Recurring meetings:** Meetings that are part of a series or have recurrence.   
* **Multitasking in meetings:** Meetings in which you've sent or read more than a minimum number of emails and/or sent more than a minimum number of messages in Teams or in Skype for Business.
* **Late-start meetings:** A meeting is considered to have started late if these circumstances apply:

    * It was an online meeting.
    * The organizer joined the meeting more than 5 minutes late, for a meeting that was scheduled to last less than or equal to 30 minutes.
    * The organizer joined the meeting more than 10 minutes late, for a meeting that was scheduled to last more than 30 minutes.
