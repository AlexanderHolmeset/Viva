# Documents

MyAnalytics also shows information for OneDrive and SharePoint documents that you have worked on. As a MyAnalytics participant, you see the following insights: 

 * The number of cloud documents that you worked on (read, edited, or reviewed). 
 * The number of cloud documents that you worked on outside of working hours.
 
To see these insights, you must have worked on at least three OneDrive or SharePoint cloud documents during the past week.
