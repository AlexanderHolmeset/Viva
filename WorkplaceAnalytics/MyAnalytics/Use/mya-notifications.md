# Inline suggestions in Outlook

<!-- REMOVE THIS PER MATHEW 6 FEB. 2020
_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

## What are inline suggestions in Outlook?

Inline suggestions in Outlook are brief data and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation.  

Inline suggestions can help boost your productivity and that of your team by displaying useful suggestions, tips, and best practices around managing email and running meetings. They help inform and guide you in making effective email and meeting decisions. They can also help you reclaim focus hours and build better collaboration habits, in addition to other practical benefits. [Types of inline suggestions](#types-of-inline-suggestions) lists some of what you might see in Outlook.

> [!Note]
> Only you can see your data, see [Privacy FAQ](../overview/mya-faq.md#privacy) for details.

## How inline suggestions work

Insights includes the following types of inline suggestions.

* **Delay email delivery**: When composing an email, MyAnalytics automatically accounts for time zones and working hours. As an [Office 365 E5 user](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is), you might see a suggestion for an alternate delivery time when recipients are in their configured working hours. This feature allows you to work whenever is most convenient for you without impacting others after hours.

   **To delay email delivery**

   1. When you see a suggested delivery time, such as **Thu, Nov 07 10:00 AM** (as shown in the graphic), select **Delay send** to confirm message delivery at that time.
   2. An insight opens to show the scheduled time. You can select:

      * **Send** (within the email) to send the email at that scheduled time.
      * **Edit time** (within the insight) to change the suggested delivery time, and then select **Send** (within the email) to send the email at the new time.
      * **Cancel** (within the insight) to cancel the scheduled delivery time, and then select **Send** (within the email) to send the email now.

   3. After you send the email, it's kept in your Outlook **Sent items** folder until the scheduled delivery time, when it's automatically delivered for you.

      Before the message is sent, you can open the message and select:

      * **Send now** to ignore the scheduled delivery time and send the email now.
      * **Cancel delay delivery** to stop the scheduled delivery time, which moves the email to your Outlook **Deleted items** folder.

* **Outstanding tasks**: When reading an email or a calendar invitation, you might see a suggestion to review outstanding tasks for a recipient.

   ![inline suggestions email image 02](../../Images/mya/use/nudges-email-02.png)

   You can select **See my tasks** to see and follow up on the potentially outstanding task in **Insights**. As shown in this graphic, you can open the related task (**Re: group manager docs**) for more details, or select **Mark as done** or **Not a task** to remove it from your task list.

## Why don't I see any inline suggestions?

Inline suggestions are available in the latest versions of Outlook for the web and Outlook for Windows with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 licenses. In Outlook for Windows, inline suggestions will show up while reading or composing email and while you have a meeting invitation open. In Outlook for the web, inline suggestions only show while reading email and meetings. These suggestions are not currently available in Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, and Outlook for Android.

Also, verify that the _Insights add-in_ is installed in Outlook. If it is not installed, you can add it by following the steps in [Add the Insights Outlook add-in](../overview/mya-faq.md#add-the-insights-outlook-add-in).

## Providing feedback

You can provide feedback for a suggestion by selecting **Feedback** in the suggestion. If you send a thumbs down, you'll see less of that suggestion. Or you can always give us general feedback on anything with the **smiley face** icon at the upper-right of the Insights Add-in panel.

## Types of inline suggestions

The following are a few of the suggestions you might see in Outlook.

### Get more time to focus

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
|Reading pane (meeting invitation)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Looks like you have a lot of meetings this/next week. Would you like to reserve some time for focused work? **See available times**  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Reminds you (the meeting attendee who has a heavy meeting load) to book time for focused work|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | This meeting conflicts with your scheduled focus time. Do you want to move your focus block? **See available times**  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Helps you to protect your focus time block, by suggesting that you move a booked focus session to another time when a meeting request conflicts with it.|

### Stay up-to-date with important relationships

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
| Reading pane (email)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  | You may have outstanding tasks for sender. Would you like to review now? **See my tasks** | Reminds you that there might be outstanding task items for the sender.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  |

### Reduce after-hours work and team impact

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
|Composing email  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  | There are some open times during your working hours to catch up on email. **Book time** | Suggests that you book time during the day to do email instead of catching up after hours. Or if you prefer to work on email outside working hours, use the delay delivery suggestion to schedule delivery of email when more recipients are in their working hours. The **Delay delivery** option enables you to get work done when you want without impacting or disturbing your team outside of their working hours. |

### Build better collaboration habits

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
| Scheduling meetings &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Could this meeting be 45 minutes? Build in some buffer time and save attendees time. **Shorten meeting** |Suggests that you shorten hour-long meetings to 45 minutes.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  |
