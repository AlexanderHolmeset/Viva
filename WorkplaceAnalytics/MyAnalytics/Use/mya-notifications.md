# Inline suggestions in Outlook

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

## What are inline suggestions in Outlook?

Inline suggestions in Outlook are brief data and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation.  

Inline suggestions can help boost your productivity and that of your team by displaying useful suggestions, tips, and best practices around managing email and running meetings. They help inform and guide you in making effective email and meeting decisions. They can also help you reclaim focus hours and build better collaboration habits, in addition to other practical benefits. [Types of inline suggestions](#types-of-inline-suggestions) lists some of what you might see in Outlook.

> [!Note]
> Only you can see your data, see [Privacy FAQ](../overview/mya-faq.md#privacy) for details.

## How inline suggestions work

Insights includes the following types of inline suggestions.

1. When composing a meeting invitation or an email.

   ![inline suggestions email](../../Images/mya/use/nudges-email.png)

   This example shows a suggestion at the top of the email that asks if you want to delay delivery. After you add recipients, MyAnalytics automatically accounts for time zones and working hours and suggests a delivery time. You can complete an item on your to-do list without worrying about impacting others:

   * Select the suggested delivery time (**Send on Thu, Nov 07 9:00 AM**), which opens Insights, where you can change the delivery time up until it is sent.
   * Or select **Dismiss** to temporarily hide the suggestion.

2. When reading an email or a calendar invitation.

3. When reading an email, it might remind you of a potentially outstanding task for the email sender. Select the link to see the task list in Insights.

## Why donâ€™t I see any inline suggestions?

Inline suggestions are available in the latest versions of Outlook for the web and Outlook for Windows with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 licenses. In Outlook for Windows, inline suggestions will show up while reading or composing email and while you have a meeting invitation open. In Outlook for the web, inline suggestions only show while reading email and meetings. These suggestions are not currently available in Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, and Outlook for Android.

Also, verify that the _Insights add-in_ is installed in Outlook. If it is not installed, you can add it by following the steps in [Add the Insights Outlook add-in](../overview/mya-faq.md#add-the-insights-outlook-add-in). 

## Providing feedback

You can provide feedback for a suggestion by selecting **Feedback** in the suggestion. If you send a thumbs down, you'll see less of that suggestion. Or you can always give us general feedback on anything with the **smiley face** icon at the upper-right of the Insights Add-in panel.

## Types of inline suggestions

The following are a few of the suggestions you might see in Outlook.

### Get more time to focus

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
|Reading pane (meeting invitation)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Looks like you have a lot of meetings this/next week. Would you like to reserve some time for focused work? **See available times**  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Reminds you (the meeting attendee who has a heavy meeting load) to book time for focused work|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | This meeting conflicts with your scheduled focus time. Do you want to move your focus block? **See available times**  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Helps you to protect your focus time block, by suggesting that you move a booked focus session to another time when a meeting request conflicts with it.|

### Stay up-to-date with important relationships

| Where it shows up | What it says | How it helps |
| :------ | ------- | --------- |
| Reading pane (email)  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  | You may have outstanding tasks for sender. Would you like to review now? **See my tasks** | Reminds you that there might be outstanding task items for the sender.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  |

Build in some buffer time and save attendees time. **Shorten meeting** |Suggests that you shorten hour-long meetings to 45 minutes.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  |
