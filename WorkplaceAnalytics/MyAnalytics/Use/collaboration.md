# Collaboration

Collaboration in MyAnalytics shows who you're working with most and how well you're maintaining your relationships at work.

The **Collaboration** page shows your weekly collaboration averages, meeting habits, and communication habits. The **Weekly average** section shows an estimate of the time you've spent in the past 4 weeks in meetings, email, chats, and calls. It is measured as a percentage of your working week which is based on the activity in your working hours.

In the **Meeting habits** section, you can switch between the **Habits** and **Meetings** view. The Habits view shows your most common types of meetings:

The **Meetings** view shows more details about all the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks:

The **Communication habits** section shows how you connected through email and chats over the last four weeks:

## About the metrics

### Meetings

Meeting metrics include any meetings that you’ve organized or accepted that have at least one other person attending. Meeting time includes meetings that take place during and outside of your set working hours. After-hours meeting time also affects your [Wellbeing metrics](../use/wellbeing.md#about-the-metrics).

The following meeting types are excluded from meeting metrics:

 * Meetings that last eight or more hours, such as all-day meetings
 * Meetings that are marked as **Private**
 * Meetings with no other participants than yourself, for example when you block time in your calendar or set reminders
 * Meetings for which **Show As** is set to any of the following values:

    * Free
    * Working Elsewhere
    * Tentative
    * Out of Office, as shown in the following graphic.

> [!Note]
> MyAnalytics counts double-booked meetings only once. For example, if you have two meetings that both run from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, MyAnalytics counts this as only one hour of meeting time.

### Email

Email metrics estimate how much time you spent sending and reading emails, across all devices, such as laptops and mobile phones. Only emails that have your name, or a group you’re a member of, on the **To** line or on the **Cc** line are included. Emails that you delete without opening are not included.

Each email you send is assigned 5 minutes. Each email you open is assigned 2.5 minutes. However, shorter times are assigned for the following scenarios:

* If you send one email and then open or send another one within 5 minutes, the time between the two actions gets assigned to the first email.
* If you open one email and then open or send another one within 2.5 minutes, the time between the two actions gets assigned to the first email.

Also, the time you spend sending or reading email outside your set work hours (as defined by your [Outlook settings](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance)) will affect your [Wellbeing metrics](../use/wellbeing.md#about-the-metrics).

### Chats and calls

MyAnalytics counts your audio calls, video calls, and chats (instant messages) that occur in Teams and in Skype for Business as collaboration activities, which are calculated as follows:

* Each chat or instant message that *you send* counts as 30 seconds.
* Each chat that *you receive* counts as zero seconds because empirically, time spent on sent messages is a good predictor of the total duration of Teams and Skype for Business sessions.
* For each impromptu call, MyAnalytics uses the actual duration of the call. An impromptu or ad hoc call is an unscheduled call that’s not included in your calendar.
* For calls that are scheduled as meetings in your calendar, the time counts as zero seconds because these calls are already being counted as meeting time.

  >[!Note]
  > Chats from Teams channels are excluded from the metrics. Skype for Business data is usually prompt. However, in rare instances, users can experience delays of two to four days. For more information see [MyAnalytics FAQ](../Overview/MyA-faq.md)

### Documents

MyAnalytics also shows information for OneDrive and SharePoint documents that you have worked on. As a MyAnalytics participant, you'll see the following insights:

 * The number of cloud documents that you worked on (read, edited, or reviewed)
 * The number of cloud documents that you worked on outside of working hours

To see these insights, you must have worked on at least three OneDrive or SharePoint cloud documents during the past week.

## Collaboration tips

You might miss out on valuable collaboration time if you're spending too much time on email or in impromptu calls, meetings, or chats. Research shows that typically doing just four to five things differently can enable you to increase your collaboration time by 18% to 24%. Over collaboration can sometimes hamper personal productivity.

#### Batch email time

To reduce distraction, try checking your inbox once an hour. If that works well, try checking email every two hours and so on. Discover how much time you can get back.

#### Group your meetings together on your calendar

If your calendar is fragmented with meetings, try grouping your meetings on your calendar, so you have longer free blocks available for team collaboration.

#### Reduce the meetings you attend and schedule

Fewer meetings enables more time for collaboration. Review your recurring meetings to make sure they're a good use of time each week.

Check the attendee lists for meetings you organize. Try condensing meetings with identical attendees.

In an office culture where meetings fill the day, make the most of yours. By setting expectations and making goals clear ahead of time, meetings can become more efficient. Giving you and your colleagues some time back.

#### Respond to meetings on time

Respond to meeting invites on time so your team knows what to expect. Coworkers can better prepare for meetings when they have a good sense of who plans to attend.

#### Give people time to prepare for meetings

Last-minute invitations are sometimes necessary, but your meetings may be more effective if you give attendees some time to prepare.

#### Include meeting agendas and action items in your invites

Add agendas and action items to get the most out of your meetings. Consider adding clarity for what you’d like participants to do with attached files in your meeting invitations.

#### Start and end meetings on time

When meetings start on time, they are more likely to finish on time and meet the objectives of the meeting. Consider blocking time for preparation before the start of meetings to avoid late starts.

Better meeting practices can improve productivity, information sharing, innovation, decision-making, and team collaboration.

#### Cancel meetings a day ahead

If possible, send cancellations to attendees the day before. Do your best to plan ahead so that attendees can optimally re-purpose that time.

#### Take long email threads offline

For long email threads that increase over the course of a few weeks, consider taking the email offline and scheduling a meeting to sync up.
