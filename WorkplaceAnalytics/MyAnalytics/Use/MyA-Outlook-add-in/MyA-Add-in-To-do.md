# Task card

MyAnalytics can remind you to do tasks that are called out in email messages. In an automatic process, MyAnalytics finds instances in which a task is promised or requested, such as:  

* An email you sent generates a Task card for you if it contains a statement such as “I will send you the plans.”
* An email you received generates a Task card for you if it contains a statement such as “Please review the highlighted items.”  

If you have one or more of these automatically generated tasks, a summary card is displayed in the MyAnalytics pane:

> [!Note]
> The Task card is available only in English.


[!INCLUDE [Get more details about task items](../../Includes/to-get-more-details.md)]

To mark a task item as done, select **Mark as done**. Task cards disappear after two weeks or after you mark them as done.
