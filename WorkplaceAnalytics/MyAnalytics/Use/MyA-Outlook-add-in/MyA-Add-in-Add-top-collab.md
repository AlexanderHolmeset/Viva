# Add top collaborator card 

Based on your communication pattern over the past few weeks, MyAnalytics automatically generates a list of individuals whom it considers to be your "top collaborators." This list serves as a convenient source of contacts that you can use for other purposes.

MyAnalytics also maintains a list of "Important people" for you, which you can view in the MyAnalytics Dashboard. MyAnalytics can notify you, for example, if you've missed an email message from someone on this list, or if they might be expecting you to complete one or more to-do items. You can add people to and remove people from this list.
