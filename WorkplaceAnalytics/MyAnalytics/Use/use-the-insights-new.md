## Prepare for your meetings

Meetings are vital for healthy collaboration. Better meeting practices can improve productivity, information sharing, innovation, decision-making, and connections among team members. Read more about best practices for running effective meetings in the [Meetings playbook](https://opdhsblobprod03.blob.core.windows.net/contents/c061aa4c5f284dcfb016c4d96b230182/95fb77fe28fe39b17203a7456d0dd375?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&si=ReadPolicy&sig=Zu8S0o%2BegwIxEDwiboGWuU28wbgR0k8QUbJ9C173EcM%3D&st=2020-05-18T15%3A39%3A07Z&se=2020-05-19T15%3A49%3A07Z). 

The **Prepare for your meetings** card shows you a list of upcoming meetings that you have organized and it helps you evaluate whether each meeting is ready to go. 

### To use this card

1.	On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Prepare for your meetings** card. This card provides information about meetings that you have organized for this week and next week (up to 10 business days in the future) and it helps you evaluate the state of those meetings.

    ![Prepare for your meetings card](../../images/mya/use/prepare-for-your-meetings.png)

2.	Select **Prepare for your meetings**. This opens a panel that displays an insight for each of your upcoming meetings:

## Track email open rates

_**Applies to**: MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is.md)_

Emails are the backbone of work communications. Better email communication can improve productivity and information sharing and speed up decision-making. This insight gives you feedback on how well your sent emails are received. 

The **Track email open rates** card can tell you how many people have opened your email and the average time they spent reading that email. This information can help you follow up with recipients if needed and/or tailor your communication style to get the job done. MyAnalytics respects user privacy; this is why: 

 * Not all emails are eligible (For more information about eligible sent emails, see [Eligibility Criterion]())
 * Approximated values are reported, and 
 * Individual recipient information is never shown. 
For more information about privacy, see [Email read rates](). If you need individual recipient information, learn about [request read receipts]() in Outlook.

### To use this card

 * On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Track email open rates** card. This card provides read statistics of the eligible emails that you sent in the last 14 days:

    ![Track email open rates](../../images/mya/use/step-1-track-open-rates.png)
 
   If you are already have a sent email open, the **Insights** pane will show you read statistics at the top of the panel, as shown here:

    ![Test email - read stats](../../images/mya/use/test-email-read-stats.png)   

   If you do not have an email open, select the **Track email open rates** card to see read statistics for all eligible sent emails.

|Open Rate	|This is the proportion of the email recipients who opened your email in Outlook.<br>For more information about these statistics, see [Open rate](#open-rate). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Depending on the importance of the email and overall open rate, you might want to follow up with the recipients. |
| Open rate summary | Brief summary of the overall readership. |	
| Forwards | The number of times the email was forwarded. | 	
| Average time spent on email | The average amount of time spent on the email by people who opened it. | If you think emails are not being read or readers are not spending enough time reading, it could be because the email is too long or the content could be better organized, for example, to first call out highlights. | 

### Open rate

The Insights add-in reports the open rate within 30 minutes of when a qualifying email was sent by you, as per the following table. Note the following:

* For open rates lower than the minimum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 20% of 10 email recipients open the email, Insights displays the open rate as < 25%.
* If the actual open rate falls between the "Minimum" and "Maximum" values shown in the table, then the actual open rate is reported.
* For open rates higher than the maximum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 98% of the email recipients open the email, the maximum value in the table will be > 95%. [[FIX WORDING IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE! SEE INFO IN OTHER WORK ITEM WITH NITHIN.]]

| Number of recipients | Open rate reported | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| 5 - 10 |	Minimum: 25% <br> Maximum: 75% |
| 11 - 20 |	Minimum: 10% <br> Maximum: 90% |
| > 21 |	Minimum: 5% <br> Maximum: 95% |

### Eligibility Criterion
Insights does not display read information about every email that you send.

<u>Requirement: qualifying messages</u>

Read statistics are shown only for qualifying messages. A qualifying message is an email message that is sent to five or more qualifying recipients. A qualifying recipient is a person who is in the same company as the sender and has a cloud mailbox. Distribution lists are expanded before counting qualifying recipients. 

After you send an email message, it can take up to 30 minutes before Insights informs you about it. If the email is sent from a delegated mailbox with "send on behalf" permission, the delegate can see the read statistics.

<u>Exceptions to qualifying messages</u>

Insights does not report about email messages in the following categories:

* Email that was sent from a shared mailbox
* Email that was sent more than 14 days ago.
* Email in which the total number of recipients (the sum of all of the recipients in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields) is less than five.
* Email sent to modern groups. (If users are following the modern group, they are included in the count.)

## View outstanding tasks

It is easy to lose track of your tasks and commitments to your colleagues over email. The View outstanding tasks card can help you make sure nothing falls through the cracks by reminding you of tasks that you've agreed to do, based on your sent mails and requests from your colleagues during the last 14 days of email communication. For example:

 * "I will send you the latest report tomorrow"
 * "Will get back to you by end of the week with a suitable meeting time"
 * A colleague asked you three days ago: "Please review this deck by the end of the week"

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select **View outstanding tasks**. This card is available only in English.

   ![Test email - read stats](../../images/mya/use/test-email-read-stats.png)   

   This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your suggested outstanding tasks.

Further, a MS To Do list can help effectively prioritize and even delegate work leading to higher productivity |

## Follow up on your requests

It can be easy to lose track of the requests you make to your colleagues once they are sent. By automatically extracting your outstanding follow ups from the last 14 days of email communication, the “Follow up on your requests” card can help you check in on requests to your colleagues. For example:

 * "Can you send me this year's latest report?"
 * "Everyone, please complete your performance evaluations by the end of the week."
 * "Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch scheduled early next week."

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select the **Follow up on your requests** card. This card is available only in English.

   ![Track email open rates](../../images/mya/use/follow-up-on-your-requests.png)    
    
   This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your suggested follow-ups.

| Add to To Do | Select this to add the task to Microsoft To Do so that you can catch up later.<br><br>Organizing your tasks with To Do can make your days more manageable and reduce the stress of things falling through the cracks. A To Do list can help effectively prioritize and even delegate work leading to higher productivity.

## Book time to focus

Research shows that on average it takes 23 minutes to refocus on a task after a distraction, and constant distraction during focused work can cause higher stress, lower productivity, and bad mood. Further, it can be hard to go deep on challenging work if you only have small chunks of time to focus between meetings or are easily distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help you make progress on your important tasks and projects.

The **Book time to focus** card can help you protect time for focused work and also minimize notifications (and thus distraction) by Teams and Skype for business chats and calls during your focus time. 

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select the **Book time to focus** card. This card appears if you have time available on your calendar during your working hours which is not blocked by meetings or appointments. 

   ![Book time to focus](../../images/mya/use/book-time-to-focus-52.png)     
     
   This opens a panel that displays all the time available to focus in the coming week, with a couple of available slots every day. With one click you can add focus time to your calendar and get ready for distraction-free deep work. You can also book all available time for focused work with one click, thus setting you up for focused work over a longer duration.

| + | Select this to add time to your calendar as focus time. |
| Pencil icon | Say you want to focus on “Sales pitch” for two hours. Select the pencil icon, change the “Focus time” label to “Sales pitch,” and then click (+). This books a two-hour appointment on your calendar with title “Sales pitch.”<br><br>You can set priority contacts in Teams to ensure that you don’t miss important messages during focus time. | 
| Book all | This books all available focus time at once, setting you up for enough protected time for deep work throughout the week. <br><br> Use [Set lunch hours](#set-lunch-hours) to set your lunch hour preferences. MyAnalytics will respect your preferences when it proposes focus time. | 

## Catch up on email

It is easy for important emails to get lost when your inbox is full of unread emails. We all could use some help with identifying important unread emails. With the **Catch up on email** card you can cut through the clutter with a summary of the most important unread email.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select the **Catch up on email** card which captures your important unread email based on last 14 days of email communication.

   ![Catch up on email](../../images/mya/use/catch-up-on-email-54.png) 
 
   This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your important unread emails: 

   ![Unread important email](../../images/mya/use/unread-important-email-54.png)  

#### Insight option details

| Card section | Notes | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| Name and icon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  | Sender of the email |
| Email subject line | Subject line preview of the email |
| Email snapshot | A snapshot of the text related to the email |
| Open | Select this to open the relevant email for your review. <br>Triaging through your important unread emails first can help you get to your important workflows faster. |

## Catch up on documents

Searching for that document you had planned to read but can’t find anymore? With so many documents shared across meetings and emails, it can be difficult to stay caught up on documents shared by your colleagues. With the Catch up on documents card you can see a list of the shared OneDrive and SharePoint documents in email that you need to catch up on.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select the **Catch up on documents** card:

   ![Catch up on documents](../../images/mya/use/catch-up-on-documents-54.png) 
 
   This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each document shared with you in the last 14 days that you have not yet opened.

| Open Email | Select this to open the related email for your review. |
| Book time | Select this to expand the card with option to book time on your calendar to review the document. |

## Add important people

On a regular day, you might have unread emails and outstanding tasks from many people but some people might be more important than others. For example, an outstanding task from your manager or a message from a key customer might be of higher priority. Based on your collaboration patterns, **Add important people** can suggest that you mark some of your contacts as important; afterwards, MyAnalytics will remind you when you have tasks to do for these important people or unread email from them.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select the **Add important people** card:

    ![Add important people](../../images/mya/use/add-important-people-54.png)  

    This opens a panel with suggestions to mark a recommended contact as important:

## Set lunch hours

Struggling to protect time for lunch? Colleagues keep sending meeting invites during your lunch hours? Not taking a lunch break can leave you feeling more tired and stressed and less focused. Even if you just take 15-20 minutes, this is a proven way to keep your levels of concentration and energy up during your day. Set lunch hours card to protect your lunch hours and personalize your MyAnalytics insights to take into account your preferred lunch hours.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, locate **Set lunch hours**:

   ![Insights plan your time away task list](../../images/mya/use/set-lunch-hours.png)  

#### Insight option details

## Plan your time away

Taking time off from work helps reduce stress and burnout and improve overall wellbeing. However, research shows that a lack of planning can reduce the benefits of taking a vacation.

The **Plan your time away** checklist can help reduce the stress of planning for upcoming time away from work. This single tool helps you:

* Resolve all your meetings in one place with a custom message about your scheduled time off.
* Compose your autoreplies and notify your team about your planned time off.
* Schedule focus time to wrap up tasks before you go and to catch up on work when you get back.

You can plan your schedule with these options all at one time or individually as you get closer to the date. You can also come back at any time and change details before you go. Insights will track your progress and update which actions are done.

## Catch up with your team

People managers often have hectic schedules, and it can be tough to stay in close contact with each team member. MyAnalytics brings together all the information managers need to stay caught up and respond quickly to important requests. 

As a manager, you can:

 * Schedule 1:1 time with a team member (or reschedule if a conflict comes up)
 * Act on tasks you promised to get done or that team members asked you to complete
 * Review important emails and documents from team members that you haven’t read yet

This feature is only available for MyAnalytics users who have direct reports listed in Azure Active Directory. If you are a manager but do not see this feature, contact your Office 365 administrator.

#### To catch up with your team

1. On Outlook or in Outlook on the web, [open the Insights add-in](add-in.md#open-the-insights-add-in).

2. Select **Catch up with your team**:

   ![Catch up with your team](../../images/mya/use/catch-up.png)

   The **Insights** pane shows team members with whom you can reconnect and actions you can take to do so:

#### To edit your team list

 * If you notice that your team member list is inaccurate, select **Edit team** to add or remove team members, as shown here:

Any changes you make apply only to your MyAnalytics experience; they do not synchronize back to Azure Active Directory.

## Meeting suggestions

Staying in touch with your top collaborators can be difficult. A quick 1:1 meeting with your key contacts can help you nurture our professional network. Meeting suggestion card can keep track of your collaboration pattern and provide meeting recommendation if case you are falling out of touch. For example, if you have not had 1:1 meeting with your manager in a while, this card can suggest setting up a 1:1 and even assist with scheduling the meeting.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, locate the **Meet with &lt;name of contact&gt;** card:

    ![Meet with person for 1:1](../../images/mya/use/meet-with-person-54.png)

## Check quiet hours impact

Studies shows that the expectation to respond to email outside of working hours results in anxiety and impacts the health of employees and their families. In fact, the mere expectation of availability outside of working hours can increase strain for your colleagues, even when they do not engage in actual work outside of working hours.

With the **Check quiet hours impact** card, you can help your team achieve work-life balance by reviewing emails your co-workers responded to outside of working hours.

### To use this card

 * In the **Insights** pane, select **Check quiet hours impact**:

   ![Check quiet hours impact](../../images/mya/use/check-quiet-hours-impact-54.png)   

   This opens a panel that displays insights about emails that might have impacted co-workers outside of their working hours:
