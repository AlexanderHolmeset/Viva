# MyAnalytics email digests

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

As a MyAnalytics user, you will receive a weekly email digest that gives you key highlights about your previous week. This email digest contains links that you can select to open your MyAnalytics dashboard.

The following is an example of an email digest.
