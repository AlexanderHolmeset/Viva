# Confirm the installation of the Insights Outlook add-in

The Insights Outlook add-in is automatically installed for your organization when you purchase one of the plans or add-ins listed in [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md). Users will start to see the Insights Outlook add-in in their Outlook application automatically after a license is assigned to them.

You can confirm that the Insights Outlook add-in is installed by looking in the "Services and add-ins" list for your organization in the Office 365 Admin center.

**To confirm the installation**

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/where-to-sign-in-to-office-365-for-business-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) with your work or school account.

2. Select the app launcher icon (<img src="../../Images/app-launcher-icon.png" alt="Office 365 app launcher icon">) in the upper left, and then select **Admin**.

    > [!Note]
    > The Admin tile appears only to Office 365 administrators.

3. Select the link to the new Admin center, which is shown in a banner at the top of the page.

    > [!Note]
    > You can see the old Admin center by selecting **Go to old admin center** at the top right corner of the new Admin center.

4. In the Admin center preview, select **Menu** > **Settings**, and then select **Services & add-ins**.

5. Confirm that **Insights by MyAnalytics** is listed.
