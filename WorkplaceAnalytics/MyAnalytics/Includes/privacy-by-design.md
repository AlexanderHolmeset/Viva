The Outlook add-in preserves all the data-subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights you see in the add-in are only available to you. No admin or manager can see these insights. They are computed as needed, from the your email and meeting information, and are never stored outside your mailbox.

Additionally, the add-in begins processing data for insights only after the first time you open it. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx) about how Microsoft protects your privacy.
