# MyAnalytics for admins

As an administrator, you benefit from knowing what MyAnalytics provides to its participants and what you can do to enable and enhance their experience.

## Benefits of use

MyAnalytics can help participants strengthen their work relationships, have more time to focus on important work, and improve their work-life balance. MyAnalytics does this by showing users insights about their work habits. It derives these insights from Microsoft 365 data about emails, meetings, calls, and chats. For more information, see [Why use MyAnalytics?](better-work-habits.md)

## You and your users are in charge

* As the admin, you control the configuration of how your users start using MyAnalytics. See [Configure MyAnalytics](../setup/configure-myanalytics.md) for details.
* Users can opt in or out from the start. See [Opt out](../use/opt-out-of-mya.md) for details.
* Users can opt out of the personal dashboard. See [Opt out of the dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md#opt-out-of-the-myanalytics-dashboard) for details.
* Users can opt out of digests. See [Opt out of digests](../use/email-digest-2.md#opt-out-of-digests) for details.
* Users can opt out of the Insights Outlook add-in. See [Opt out of the Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md#opt-out-of-the-insights-outlook-add-in) for details.
* Users can opt out of inline suggestions. See [Opt out of inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md#opt-out-of-inline-suggestions) for details.

## Data privacy

None of a user's personal information is shared with their co-workers or managers. MyAnalytics adheres to compliance regulations, such as the GDPR. Also see the [MyAnalytics privacy guide](privacy-guide.md).

## Granting access

Soon after you assign a license with the MyAnalytics service plan to a user, they'll get access to MyAnalytics elements, such as the [Dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md), [Digests](../use/email-digest-2.md), [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../use/mya-notifications.md), the [Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md), and the [MyAnalytics welcome message](../use/mya-welcome-email.md).
Access to these elements depends on the plan in place at your organization; for details, see [Access to MyAnalytics elements](plans-environments.md#access-to-myanalytics-elements).
