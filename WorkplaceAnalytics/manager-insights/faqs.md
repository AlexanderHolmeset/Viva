# Frequently asked questions about Manager insights

##### Q1 What is Workplace Analytics?

Workplace Analytics helps managers like you identify patterns and habits that impact employee wellbeing and collaboration effectiveness by using data from everyday work that you and your team do in Microsoft 365. Learn more about Workplace Analytics in this [introductory video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4xfQk?autoplay=true).

##### Q2 Which roles have access to this manager insights page?

Only managers granted access to Workplace Analytics in [Manager settings](../use/settings.md#manager-settings) can see insights about their teams.

##### Q3 Who is included as a measured employee?

Measured employees include those who are assigned a Workplace Analytics license and are included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager. This hierarchy is based on the latest available HR data uploaded into Workplace Analytics by the Admin.

##### Q4 Why is the number of measured employees different from my current number of direct and indirect reports?

The number of measured employees might be different because:

* One or more of the employees on your team are not assigned a Workplace Analytics license.
* Or the latest available HR data uploaded into Workplace Analytics did not include the latest hierarchy or employee data.

  >[!Note]
  >HR data is typically uploaded monthly on the last day of the month. If a person recently joined your, you might need to wait until next month for that person's data to be included in your team's insights. If you don’t see your insights data change, ask your admin when the next HR data upload will occur.

##### Q5 Can I see names of people in my team who are measured to confirm my team is accurately represented?

Not currently. However, it is being considered for future releases.

##### Q6 Can I configure the time period or thresholds for the insights?

Currently, you cannot configure the settings for these insights. The current time period is the past six months.

##### Q7 What are the numbers in the insights based on, such as 15 minutes for coaching or one hour for after-hours work?

These numbers are based on academic research and learnings from a number of customer engagements.

##### Q8 How do after-hours insights reflect when working with teams in different time zone?

After-hours communication is determined at an individual level, based on their Outlook calendar settings. For example, if you are working from Redmond in PST with your Outlook work hours set as 8AM to 5PM, and you collaborate with a team member who is in India in a meeting at 9PM PST, this meeting counts toward your after-hours collaboration. However, it’s not counted as after hours for the person in India. This after-hours collaboration is then aggregated across all team members in your team.

##### Q9 Do 1:1 insights include unscheduled calls or chats in Teams?

No, currently the insights only include scheduled calls and not unscheduled calls or chats in Teams.

##### Q10 Are my team insights visible to anyone else?

No, only you can see insights about your team. Managers higher up can only see aggregated insights at their level, with no individual team data shown. The insights also use differential privacy to further protect your team's personal data.

#### Q11 Do the "Teams like yours" metrics use my organizational averages?

Yes, Teams like yours metrics use other teams who are in the same hierarchy that report to your manager within your organization. If you have only one peer team or no peer team, the metrics use and show your company's averages.

##### Q12 Can I see insights for both direct and indirect reports?

While this capability is currently unavailable, it is planned for a future release.

##### Q13 Can I see how my team’s collaboration changes over time and compare it with different timelines?

While this capability is currently unavailable, it is being considered for a future release.

#### Q14 As a manager, can I see metrics at my organizational level, such as my manager’s team metrics?

While this capability is currently unavailable, it is being considered for a future release.

##### Q15 Is it safe to share Insights with my team?

Yes, you can share these insights with your team to generate a conversation and collectively decide what the norms are for your team. See [Best practices](../tutorials/gm-best-practices.md) for ways to approach your team about these insights.

#### Q16 What is a plan?

By combining the capabilities of Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics, plans help you transform insights from Workplace Analytics into targeted change plans across your team. See [Plans](../tutorials/solutionsv2-intro.md) to learn more.  

##### Q17 Why are some employees in my team not eligible to enroll in plans?

Employees might not be eligible for a plan if:

* They do not have MyAnalytics enabled.
* Are already enrolled in an existing plan.
* The team does not meet the minimum group size limit.
