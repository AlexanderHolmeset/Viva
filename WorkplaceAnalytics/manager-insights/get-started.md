# Get started with manager insights

As a people manager, confirm the following prerequisites. You can then sign in and see your team's data in Workplace Analytics.

## Prerequisites

* **Manager access** - Confirm that the Workplace Analytics admin has given you access to Workplace Analytics in [Manager settings](../use/settings.md#manager-settings).
* **Licensed team** - You and your team are measured employees who are assigned a Workplace Analytics license and your team is included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager. The hierarchy is based on the latest available HR data uploaded into Workplace Analytics by the admin.
* **Minimum team size** - Your team structure must meet the minimum group size of nine or more measured and licensed employees.

## Sign in to view your team's insights

After confirming the prerequisites, open [Workplace Analytics](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com). If prompted, sign in with your work account. Manager insights include the following information.

* **Employee experience** - Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover. These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your team is working after hours on email or instant messages, and if your team is getting enough 1:1 time with you and other managers.

* **Team effectiveness** - Nimble companies can more efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage. The insights in this section show if your team has time to collaborate for rapid innovation, and to focus and produce higher quality work.

* **My team's data** - Insights are scoped to your team's data, including employees who you directly or indirectly manage within your defined organizational group. The date range shows you the most recent [Organizational data](../use/organizational-data.md) that's been uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, including the current date range and the number of *measured employees* in your team. Your Workplace Analytics admin can give you more details about uploads and measured employees.
