# Manager insights in Teams

As a people manager, you can use the **My Team** page of the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams to get a snapshot of teams collaboration patterns, which are leading indicators for overall employee experience and wellbeing.

While you can also see these outcome-based insights and their related best practices in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them within Teams, the tool that you're already using for communicating during remote work and for meetings, sharing files, and sending instant messages to employees and other leaders.

## Your personal insights

In addition to information about your team, the Viva Insights app also shows you [personal insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app) about your own daily work as an employee:

* **Stay connected** – Helps you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues with AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. For details, see [Stay connected](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app-use-insights#stay-connected).
* **Protect time** – Helps you reduce distractions, stop multi-tasking, and find time to focus on your core priorities. For details, see [Protect time](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app-use-insights#protect-time).

See [Teams Insights app](https://docs.microsoft.com/insights/teams-app) for details on how to set up and use it.

## App comparison

Both the Teams Insights app and the Workplace Analytics app show you outcomes, insights for those outcomes, and the recommended best practices for each insight. Here's how the two apps differ:

* The Viva Insights app shows you best practice recommendations within Teams.
* The Workplace Analytics app shows best practices that include the option to create a [Plan](./plans.md) for your team.
