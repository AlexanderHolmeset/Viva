# Best practices for focus work

Having scheduled, uninterrupted time to focus on deep work provides employees an opportunity to master difficult tasks and produce results at an elite level, in terms of quality and speed.

## Why it matters

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed:

* "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work."
* "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."
* "64 percent said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking."
* "62 percent said meetings miss opportunities to bring the team closer together."

## Best practices

* Take an employee survey to gather data and impressions about the organization's meeting frequency and its impact on how much work is or isn't getting done during the day.
* Come together as a team to share everyone's feedback. It's important to process all contributions and analysis from all team members to begin the process of change.
* Agree on a collective, personal goal based on the survey feedback. For example, declare "meeting free" periods to free up time on everyone's calendar. This increases individual focus time and productivity and reduces the spillover into personal time.
* Assess and discuss progress around meeting habits and its impact on focus. Small, tangible wins provide something for people to celebrate, and small losses provide opportunities for learning and correction.
* Regularly and openly check in with employees. Frustration, resentment and even hopelessness are signals that people are falling back into bad patterns. Changing protocols and behaviors takes time, and sustaining momentum requires consistent attention.
