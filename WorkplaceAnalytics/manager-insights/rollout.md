When you're ready to roll out the Manager insights to your organization, do the following to introduce and educate managers on how to use this tool to better understand their team collaboration habits and to apply them to better support their teams.

>[!Note]
>As of June 2021, the app no longer sends an automated welcome email to managers who get access to Manager insights in Workplace Analytics.

* **Enable for key leaders** - Enable Manager insights for key leaders, so they can learn about them first hand and understand their value. For those who are new to Workplace Analytics, you can also share the  [Introduction to Workplace Analytics video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4xfQk?autoplay=true).

* **Introduce to managers** - Ask business leaders to introduce this new tool to their managers with this [sample email](./email-to-managers.docx). It's important that managers understand how to use these insights to best support their teams. Recruiting managers in teams that already support your organization, such as in IT, Training, Corporate communications, and Support, allows them to learn and then help others learn how to use this new tool.

* **Set up a communications channel** - Set up a communications channel with your managers to evangelize the tool and answer any questions that they might have. Consider using Teams, Yammer, or an email distribution group. You can discuss strategic priorities for the organization, such as 1:1 coaching, meeting reductions, or Teams adoption.
