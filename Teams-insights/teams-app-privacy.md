# Privacy guide 

When data is processed in the Teams Insights app, Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Insights protects privacy in the following ways: 

 * **Personal and private** – Content in your Insights are personal and private and are only available to you and cannot be accessed by anybody else in your organization, including your IT admin or your manager. 

 * **Everyone's data is kept private** – Teams Insights does not include any new personally identifiable information about anybody else in your organization. The insights and actions are based on information generated by you and your organization just by going about your regular workday. Your insights are based on information that you already have access to but can’t quickly aggregate without help. 

 * **Mailbox security** – Teams Insights uses Exchange Online email and calendar data and processes and stores any insights or actions inside your Exchange Online mailbox, so data security is built in and enforced by Exchange. 

 * **GDPR compliant** – Microsoft complies with the GDPR when providing insights and actions in the app.
