# Discover the Viva Insights app

The Microsoft Viva Insights app is pre-installed in Microsoft Teams for most organizations. This means that you won't need to find and install it, as described in [Install the app](#install-the-app). After it is installed, you can pin it to the Teams app bar (the left navigation bar) to make it easy to find. To learn how, see [Discover and pin the app](#discover-and-pin-the-app).

## Prerequisites

To be able to use the Viva Insights app, you must have the following:

* Access to Microsoft Teams
* An Exchange Online account

## Discover and pin the app

### On desktop and web clients

1. Select **More** (the ellipsis) on the Microsoft Teams app bar.

2. In the search field, type **Viva Insights**.
