# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights Reflect feature 

The Reflect feature helps you become more aware of how you're feeling, which can benefit both your productivity and your wellbeing. In fact, research has shown that even the act of taking a moment to reflect has positive benefits for wellbeing. 

>[!Important]
>Performing self-reflection in the way that this feature provides &mdash; by selecting an emoji &mdash; is an entirely private action. No one else knows can see what you chose. 

## Reflect 

You can choose your own frequency for self-reflection. Once daily might work well for you &mdash; or more often than that, or less often.  

1. On the Viva Insights Home page, locate the **How are you feeling?** card.

2. Select an emoji. The card givs you feedback to acknowledge your choice.

3. (Optional) Select **Reflection history** to see how your feelings have changed over time, as indicated by the emojis you've chosen. For example:

4. (Optional) Set a reminder to practice reflection. Go to [Set a reminder to self-reflect](#set-a-reminder-to-self-reflect).
   
## Set a reminder to self-reflect

Remind yourself to self-reflect in the future.

1. On the **Build a habit of emotional awareness!** card, select a day and time:

2. Select **Set reminders**. 

   On the day and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to self-reflect.

  Selecting the reminder notification opens the Praise feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Send a praise message](viva-insights-praise.md#send-a-praise-message).
