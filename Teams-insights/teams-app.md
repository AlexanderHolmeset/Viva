# Teams insights app

The Teams Insights app helps you stay on top of your tasks and get more done by providing insights for improving your collaboration, wellbeing, and productivity. It derives these insights by summarizing your Office 365 data – data that you already have access to – about emails, meetings, calls, and chats. 

By using Insights, you and your teams can: 

 * **Stay connected** – Teams Insights will help you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues through features such as AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. 
 * **Protect time** – Teams Insights will help you find more time to eliminate distractions, stop multi-tasking, and focus on your core priorities. 

The insights that this app presents are completely personal and private. Only you – not your manager and not the system administrator – can see your insights. For more information, see the following section, [Privacy guide](#privacy-guide). 

### How it works 

The insights and actions in the Insights app are based on your Exchange Online mailbox data, such as email and calendar data. The insights are derived from data that is already available to you in your Exchange Online mailbox. For example, if you want to determine what commitments you made to others, you could manually review each email in your mailbox. The Insights app simply saves you from this tedious process. 

> [!Note] 
> To have access to the Insights app, you will need an Exchange Online license. 

### GDPR compliance 

Microsoft helps data controllers meet the following obligations for the Insights app: 
* **Secure and protect users’ personal data** &ndash; All data is stored in the employees’ Exchange Online mailbox. The computed metrics, such as tasks, are appended to the mailbox. Thus, the Insights meets this obligation by virtue of Exchange Online also meeting the obligation: 
   * Microsoft will not mine customer data in Exchange Online for advertising. 
   * Microsoft will not voluntarily disclose Exchange Online customer data to law enforcement agencies. 
   * Microsoft will meet all requirements related to encryption of Exchange Online data and implement controls to reduce security risks and help ensure business continuity, as described in ISO 27001 and 27018. 
* **Notify users in the event that a breach is detected** &ndash; Microsoft will notify customer privacy contacts within 72 hours of Microsoft becoming aware of a breach by using Office 365 incident response standard operating procedures. 
* **Honor user requests (DSRs) to export, delete, or restrict processing personal data** &ndash; Microsoft supports your need to honor user requests in the following ways. 
   * **Data export requests** &ndash; Users can view the insights in the Briefing email and manage it if they want to have permanent copies of their information. 
   * **Request to restrict processing** &ndash; Use PowerShell to opt employees out of the Briefing email. Or employees can individually unsubscribe from the Briefing email to restrict processing of their data. 
   * **Delete employee data** &ndash; Sign in to [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) and then remove the employee's data through the User Management Portal.
