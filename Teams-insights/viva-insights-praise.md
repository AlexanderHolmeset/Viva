# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights Praise feature 

Science agrees: People are happier and more productive when they get recognition for their efforts. You can use the Praise app to send acclaim to your employees and coworkers. You can have it deliver in a private chat, or for wider recognition, you can send it in a Teams channel conversation. 

The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).

You can also set a reminder for yourself to send praise at a later date. See [Set a praise reminder](#set-a-praise-reminder).

## Send praise 

To send praise, first open the praise feature. You can do so in two places: 

 * The [Home page](#send-praise-from-the-home-page) of the Viva insights app 
 * The [content pane](#send-praise-from-the-content-pane) of Teams

### Send praise from the Home page 

1. On the Home page, select the **Send praise to your colleagues** card:

   ![Praise on Home page](images/praise-from-home.png)

   <!-- VERIFY THAT YOU CAN CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE CARD, NOT JUST THE IMAGES OR WORDS. -->

2. Continue with the steps in [Send a praise message](#send-a-praise-message). 

### Send praise from the content pane 

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select **Praise**:

   ![Select Praise](images/content-pane-select-praise.png)

   (If the Praise feature does not appear, follow the steps in [Find the Praise feature](#find-the-praise-feature).) 

2. Continue with the steps in [Send a praise message](#send-a-praise-message).    

#### Find the Praise feature

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select more options (the ellipsis):

2. In the **Find an app** field, start typing "praise."

   ![Select icon for Praise app](images/find-app-praise.png)   

4. Continue with the steps in [Send a praise message](#send-a-praise-message).    

### Send a praise message

1. After the Praise app opens, choose a badge to include with your praise message.

   ![Choose badge](images/praise-badges.png)

2. Add the names of the people you want to praise. 

3. Choose the visibility of this praise. To make this choice, you must first decide whether you want to keep the praise private between you and the recipient or to make it visible (as a form of kudos, for example) to everyone in a Teams channel:

   * To make the praise message appear privately in a 1:1 chat between you and the recipient, select **1:1 chat**. This option is available only if you and the recipient have already participated in a Teams chat together. If you are sending praise to more than one person, you can use this option only if you've had 1:1 chats with each of the recipients. 

   * To let all the members of a Teams channel or subchannel see the praise message, select **Teams channel**. This option is available only if all of the praise recipients are participants in the Teams channel or subchannel that you choose. 

4. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note.

5. Select **Preview**.

6. On the preview page, inspect the praise badge. If you need to edit it, select **Back**. Change the badge choice, the recipients list, or the personalized note. After you've finished making changes, select **Preview** and then select **Send**.

## Set a praise reminder

Remind yourself to send praise to a co-worker later.

1. On the Home page, select the **Send praise to your colleagues** card:

   ![Praise on Home page](images/praise-from-home.png)

2. On the praise reminder card, select a day and time: 

   ![Praise reminder](images/praise-reminder.png)

3. Select **Set reminder**. 

   On the day and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to send praise. Selecting the reminder notification opens the Praise feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Send a praise message](#send-a-praise-message).
