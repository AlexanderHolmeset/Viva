## Run Headspace in the background

You can open Headspace in a new window. This lets you play its musical meditations while continuing your collaboration in Teams.

1. Locate the pinned Insights app on the left rail of Microsoft Teams.

2. Right-click the Insights icon.

3. Select **Pop out app**.

   This opens a new window in which the Insights app is running.

4. In this second window, start Headspace and then start a meditation as described in [Start a guided meditation](#start-a-guided-meditation).

5. Optionally, minimize the instance of Insights that you just opened. You can continue working in Teams in the original Teams window.
