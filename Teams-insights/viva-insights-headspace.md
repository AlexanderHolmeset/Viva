1. Locate the pinned Insights app on the left navigation pane of Teams.

2. Right-click the Insights icon.

3. Select **Pop out app**.

   This opens a new window in which the Insights app is running.

4. In this second window, select **More mindfulness exercises** and then start a Headspace meditation or Focus music as described in [Start a guided meditation](#start-a-guided-meditation).

5. Optionally, minimize the Insights window that you just opened. You can continue working in Teams in the original Teams window.
