# Discover the Microsoft Viva Insights app

The Viva Insights app is pre-installed in Teams for most organizations. This means that you won't need to find and install it, as described in [Install the app](#install-the-app). After it is installed, you can pin it to the Teams app bar (the left navigation bar) to make it easy to find. To learn how, see [Discover and pin the app](#discover-and-pin-the-app).

## Discover and pin the app

### On desktop and web clients

1. Select **More** (the ellipsis) on the Microsoft Teams app bar.

2. In the search field, type **Viva Insights**.

3. Select **Insights** to open the app.

4. Right-click the app icon and select **Pin** (![Pin an app](Images/pin.png)) to make and keep your app visible in the Teams app bar.

### On the iOS and Android mobile platforms

1. Select **More** (the ellipsis) on the Microsoft Teams app bar.  

2. Select **Insights** to open the app.
