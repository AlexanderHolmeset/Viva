# Microsoft Viva Insights app Home page 

When you select **Insights** on the app bar of Microsoft Teams, the Microsoft Viva Insights app opens to the Home page:

The Home page makes it easy to start using the other features of the Viva Insights app. You reach some features in the menu bar and others in the main area of the page:

### Alert card

On the Home page, the card in the upper left alerts you in ways that depend on the time of day and the events in your Outlook calendar. For example, if your lunchtime (as [configured in MyAnalytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights#set-lunch-hours)) is approaching, it lets you know how soon:

The card's color changes to alert you of other events, such as scheduled focus time, meetings, and even the switch from morning to afternoon and the end of your scheduled workday or [Virtual commute]():

The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).

### Take a break

This feature offers a one-minute "breathing break" animated experience that you can use as often as you want during your workday. To start it, select **Start**. 

### Microsoft To-Do

This card shows tasks that are in your **To-Do** list that are due today or for which a reminder for today has been set. Select **All To-Do tasks for today** to open the Tasks app in Teams.
