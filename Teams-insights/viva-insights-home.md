# Microsoft Viva Insights app Home page 

When you select **Insights** on the app bar of Microsoft Teams, the Microsoft Viva Insights app opens to the Home page:

The Home page makes it easy to open the other features of the Viva Insights app:

Reflect
Stay Connected
Protect time
Send praise



On the Home page, the card in the upper left alerts you in ways that depend on the time of day and the events in your Outlook calendar. For example, if your lunchtime (as [configured in MyAnalytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights#set-lunch-hours)) is approaching, it lets you know how soon:

The card's color changes to alert you of other events, such as scheduled focus time, meetings, and even the switch from morning to afternoon and the end of your scheduled workday or [Virtual commute]():

The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).
