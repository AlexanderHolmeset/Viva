# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights protect time app 

Research shows that on average it takes 23 minutes to refocus on a task after a distraction, and constant distraction during focused work can cause higher stress, lower productivity, and bad mood. Further, it can be hard to go deep on challenging work if you have only small chunks of time to focus between meetings or are easily distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help you make progress on your important tasks and projects. 

Microsoft Viva Insights can help you protect time for focused work and minimize notifications (and thus distraction) by Teams and Skype for business chats and calls during your focus time. 

In the following example, select **Book Time** to reserve the time slot for focused work. If you donâ€™t need the time anymore, you can select **Remove slot** to free up your calendar. You can also select edit (the pencil icon) to change the name of the focus time block; this automatically updates the subject of this focus-time booking on your calendar.
