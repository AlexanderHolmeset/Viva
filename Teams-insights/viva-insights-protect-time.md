# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights Protect time feature 

You can use the Protect time feature to [schedule focus time](#schedule-focus-time) or to [start your virtual commute](#start-a-virtual-commute) at the end of the day.  

## Schedule focus time

Research shows that on average it takes 23 minutes to refocus on a task after a distraction, and constant distraction during focused work can cause higher stress, lower productivity, and bad mood. Further, it can be hard to go deep on challenging work if you have only small chunks of time to focus between meetings or are easily distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help you make progress on your important tasks and projects. 

Microsoft Viva Insights can help you protect time for focused work and minimize notifications (and thus distraction) by Teams and Skype for business chats and calls during your focus time. 

In the following example, select **Book Time** to reserve the time slot for focused work. If you donâ€™t need the time anymore, you can select **Remove slot** to free up your calendar. You can also select edit (the pencil icon) to change the name of the focus time block; this automatically updates the subject of this focus-time booking on your calendar.

### Set up virtual commute

The first time that you open the Protect time feature, you will be prompted to schedule your virtual commute reminders:

On this card, choose the days on which you want to see the virtual-commute reminder and the time of day, and then select **Set reminder**. 

> [!Note] 
> <ul><li>You can choose to see virtual-commute reminders on any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.</li><li>The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You cannot set different times for different days of the week.</li></ul>
