# Personal insights FAQ

The following are the most frequently asked questions about personal insights within the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams.

##### Q1. Does the Microsoft Viva Insights app comply with GDPR? 

**A1.** Yes. The Viva Insights app complies with GDPR requirements. (See [GDPR compliance](viva-teams-app-privacy.md#gdpr-compliance).)

##### Q2. Can users see information about other users in the Viva Insights app?

**A2.** The personal insights in the Insights app include only existing information that’s already available in the user’s mailbox. The insights surface content from documents, emails, and meetings to make it easier for the user to find what’s most important for their day ahead. Users cannot see any new information about other users that wasn’t already available in their mailboxes.

##### Q3. Can my manager, administrator, or anyone else at my organization see what’s in my Insights app?

**A3.** No. Personal insights are private and visible to you and only you. Personal information in the Insights app is from your mailbox and stored in your mailbox. Insights just make it easier to find items that might need attention.

##### Q4. How can I send feedback to Microsoft about the Viva Insights app?

**A4.** There are two ways to provide feedback through the Insights app:

* At the bottom of every Insight is the question: "Is this helpful?" Select **Yes** or **No** to provide feedback.

* Every page in the Insights app has the question, "Is this helpful?" at the bottom-right corner. Select **Yes** or **No** to provide feedback.  

   After you select **Yes** or **No** on one of these options, a dialog box appears in which you can share more. Select the **Allow Microsoft to contact** box if you'd like Microsoft to contact you to follow up on your feedback.

##### Q5. What data does the Viva Insights app use?

**A5.** Insights uses:

* Information from email items:
  * Metadata. This includes the email's timestamp, names of sender and recipients, and "read" status.
  * Task statements. Statements that people have made in the body text of the email. These statements are used to create task cards for your use only.

<!-- THIS 'TASK CARDS' LINK NEEDS TO GO HERE: [task cards](../WorkplaceAnalytics/MyAnalytics/Use/MyA-Outlook-add-in/MyA-Add-in-To-do.md)  WHICH REPLACED [task cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/mya-outlook-add-in/mya-add-in-to-do) -->

* Information from calendar items:
  * Type (meeting or appointment)
  * Status (busy, free, out-of-office, tentative)
  * Category
  * Subject
  * Duration
  * Attendees
* OneDrive SharePoint data: Viva Insights shows a count of OneDrive and SharePoint documents that you have worked on.

Insights does not use:  

Email and calendar data from people outside your organization, with the following exception: Insights uses data that is present in your own Office 365 mailbox. For example, if you conduct a meeting with a person outside your organization, the start and end times of that meeting can be found in your mailbox and are visible to you. This data, therefore, can be used in computations about your collaboration history.

##### Q6. Why do I not see the insights and suggestions that are described in the documentation?

**A6.** To have access to the Viva Insights app, you will need an Exchange Online license.
