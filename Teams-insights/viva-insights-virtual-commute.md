# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights Virtual commute feature 

You can start the Virtual commute feature from either of two places, the [Alert card](#alert-card) or the [Protect time](#protect-time) feature. 

## Alert card

The Alert card reads, "It's time to wrap up your day" to indicate that you can start your virtual commute now.

This message appears at the following times:

 * If you have configured Virtual commute reminders, the message appears for a 30-minute period that starts 15 minutes before the time that you configured. For information about making this and other settings, see [Insights app settings](teams-app-settings.md). 
 * If you have not configured Virtual commute reminders, the message appears 30 minutes before the end of your workday as [scheduled in Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance). 

## Protect time

### Start a virtual commute

On the Protect time page, under **Ready to wrap up?**, select **Start**.

This causes your virtual commute to start immediately. For information about the virtual commute experience, see [Virtual commute steps](#virtual-commute-steps).

Starting a virtual commute this way does not affect the scheduled days and time of day that you set in [Set up virtual commute](#set-up-virtual-commute).

#### Set up virtual commute

The first time that you open the Protect time feature, you will be prompted to schedule your virtual commute reminders:

![Schedule virtual commute](Images/sched-virtual-commute-70.png)  

On this card, choose the days on which you want to see the virtual-commute reminder and the time of day, and then select **Set reminder**. 

[!INCLUDE [Virtual commute notes](../includes/virtual-commute-details.md)]

If you need to adjust these settings at any time, you can do so on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [Settings > Virtual commute](teams-app-settings.md#virtual-commute).

#### Virtual commute steps

The virtual commute experience consists of the following four steps. All four steps are optional; to skip a step, select **Next**. 

1. **Close out current tasks** &ndash; Virtual commute shows you your tasks on the Microsoft To-Do list whose due date is today or that have a reminder set for today. In this step, you can mark each task as complete (select "**It's done**") or set a reminder. If you currently have no tasks, this step is not shown and you go directly to **Add new tasks**.

2. **Add new tasks** &ndash; Use this step to add tasks to your list. Tasks that you add on this page will appear in two places: 

   * If you subscribe to the Cortana briefing email, you'll see your tasks there. 

   * If you add a task today, it will appear tomorrow on the **Microsoft To-Do** card on the Home page:

     ![Home page to-do card](Images/home-to-do.png)  

    After you've finished adding tasks &ndash; or if you have no tasks to add &ndash; select **Next**. 

3. **Preview of tomorrow** &ndash; In this step, you see the events (such as meetings) that are on your schedule for tomorrow. The purpose of this step is to reduce surprises so that you can be prepared for all that's on your schedule. 

4. **Opportunity for reflection** &ndash; At the end of your workday, this step lets you reflect on your feelings, just as you would by using the [Reflect](viva-insights-reflect.md) feature on the Home page. Select an emoji, view an acknowledgement of your choice, and then select **Next**. This optional step helps you build the healthy habit of checking in with yourself.  

<!-- NOTE FOR WAVE 3: HEADSPACE, A 3RD-PARTY MEDITATION APP, WILL APPEAR HERE WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE. WE'LL NEED TO ENABLE SOUND FOR IT FIRST. THIS FEATURE BELONGS TO PETER B. [30:00] -->
