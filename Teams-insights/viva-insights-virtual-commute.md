# Use the Microsoft Viva Insights Virtual commute feature 

You can start the Virtual commute feature from either of two places, the time-aware card and the Protect time feature. 

### Time-aware card

The time-aware card reads, "It's time to wrap up your day" to indicate that you can start your virtual commute now.

This message appears at the following times:

 * If you have configured Virtual commute reminders, the message appears for a 30-minute period that starts 15 minutes before the time that you configured. For information about making this and other settings, see [Insights app settings](teams-app-settings.md). 
 * If you have not configured Virtual commute reminders, the message appears 30 minutes before the end of your workday as [scheduled in Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance).
