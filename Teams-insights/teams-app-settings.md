# Configure the Microsoft Viva Insights app

Use the Settings page to configure the features of the Viva Insights app. You can, for example, turn on or turn off the reminders or change the day and hour settings for features such as [Praise](viva-insights-reflect.md) or [Reflection](viva-insights-reflect.md).

To configure features, start by opening the **Settings** page:

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select the ellipsis (...) and then select **Settings**:

> [!Note]
> Select **About** to open the product documentation for the Viva Insights app.

2. On the left side of the page, to the right of the App bar, select an aspect to configure. Select **Workweek** to edit the times that you work, select **My Team** (if youâ€™re a manager) to edit the composition of your team, or set recurring reminders for the other features.

   The following sections describe your choices:

   * <u>Workweek</u> &mdash; Edit the days of the week that you work, your start time and end timne, and your time zone. These settings are kept synchronized with the same settings in [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance). That is, if you change them in one place, they will be updated everywhere that they appear.

   * <u>My Team</u> &mdash; (This option is available only to people who are recognized in AAD as managers.) This option initially shows your team as it is listed in AAD. Use this option to update the list of team members. After you edit your team members here, it is no longer synchronized in AAD. 

   **Set recurring reminders**

   You can set recurring reminders for self-reflection, for sending praise, or for starting your virtual commute. You can schedule these reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings. 

   The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders; you cannot set different times for different days of the week. The reminder will not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but within 15 minutes on either side of it. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could show up anytime between 4:45 and 5:15.

   Each reminder will appear in your Teams activity feed. After it does, you can select it there and it will open the feature (reflection, praise, or virtual commute) directly in the Viva Insights app.  

   * <u>Reflection</u> &mdash; Edit the schedule for reminders to self-reflect. Change the days and time to receive reminders, and then select **Set reminders**. 

   * <u>Praise</u> &mdash; Edit the schedule for praise reminders. Change the days and time to receive reminders, and then select **Set reminders**. 

   * <u>Virtual commute</u> &mdash; Choose the days on which you want to see the virtual-commute reminder and the time of day, and then select **Set reminders**. 

<!-- NOTE FROM LEANNA MARCH 1, 2021: [LR] Quiet time actually isn't a concept we need to tackle in this round of documentation updates. Quiet time settings won't be available for at least a few more months, so we can cover that later on.
