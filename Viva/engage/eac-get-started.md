# Get started using the Engage admin center

## Licensing 

**Premium experience**
Admin users with access to Viva Engage through Microsoft Viva in Microsoft 365, Microsoft Viva Suite, Viva Topics licensing, or existing Yammer service plans will see the Admin Center within Viva Engage Teams app.  

To have access to the premium features, the user will need a license to the Viva Engage Communities and Communications service plan.  

**Seeded Experiences: Viva Engage and Answers**

Anyone who is using Yammer or accesses Yammer in your tenant today will have access to the Engage seeded experiences, including the Answers seeded experience. 

If you are enforcing Yammer licensing in your tenant, you will need to have a Yammer license or a Viva Engage Core license to access seeded experiences. 

(insert table here for the service plans available)

The configurations include:  
- Assigning Engage admin
