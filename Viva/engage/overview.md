# Overview
Viva Engage connects leaders and coworkers by helping them find answers to questions, share their unique stories, and strengthen connections at work. Viva Engage builds on Yammer, and brings together Yammer’s experiences—communities, open conversations, and personalized discovery—with new capabilities for self-expression and sharing through storyline and stories, and upcoming innovations.

-The ability to pin the app for yourself, or for a subset of your organization.

-Notifications, such as announcements and @mentions, in your Teams Activity feed.
