# Overview
Viva Engage connects leaders and coworkers by helping them find answers to questions, share their unique stories, and strengthen connections at work. Viva Engage builds on Yammer, and brings together Yammer’s experiences—communities, open conversations, and personalized discovery—with new capabilities for self-expression and sharing through storyline and stories, and upcoming innovations.

## What’s different about Viva Engage from Yammer?

The Viva Engage is built on the foundation of Yammer, but within Teams. It contains all the functionality from Yammer, plus also extends the capabilities of Yammer with new functionality, such as posts and stories in storylines (coming soon).  

-The app includes the following Teams functionality: 

-The ability to pin the app for yourself, or for a subset of your organization.

-Notifications, such as announcements and @mentions, in your Teams Activity feed. 

-A channel tab that lets you add a community or topic to a Teams channel. For more information, see [Add a Yammer page to a Teams channel](url).

-An Office connector in a team.
