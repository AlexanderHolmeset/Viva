# Leadership Identification in Microsoft Viva Engage

Leaders naturally want to share vision, updates, and perspectives to build culture, manage change, and drive engagement with the people they lead. Viva Engage empowers leaders to more effectively connect with, communicate to, and listen to their employees. This begins with identifying leaders and the audiences they want to engage. Leadership identification and audience management enables organizations to designate leaders, configure their audience and even to connect leaders with the entire organization. 

Leadership identification and audience management is a prerequisite for other leadership features of Viva Engage, including leadership announcements, campaigns, audience analytics, and leadership corner. 

## Identify leaders

Engage admins, corporate communicators, existing Yammer verified admins, and Yammer network admins can identify leaders in Viva Engage and Yammer. Leaders can be identified individually or by importing groups of leaders. 

1. From Viva Engage, open the … menu in the upper left corner, then select **Admin**.

2. Select **Feature management**, then select **Leadership identification and audiences**.  

![View of Engage Admin Center](/Viva/media/engage/IMG/VE-admin-center-leadership-id.png)

The **Manage leaders** page allows you to identify leaders by searching for users and groups.
3. Select **Add leaders**. 

4. Enter the name of the user or group you would like to identify as leaders.  

You can search for individual users, security groups, email enabled security groups, or distribution lists.

5. Select the user or group. 

6. If you are importing a group, select **Continue** to confirm your choice.

The group members will be added as leaders. Note: subsequent changes to group memberships will not automatically update who is identified as a leader in Viva Engage. You can add the group again to add new members, or add and remove individual leaders.

7. The user or group members will appear in the **Manage leaders** list

## Configure a leader's audience

After a leader has been identified, the next step is to identify the leader’s audience, which can be performed by the Engage admin, Yammer verified admin, Yammer network admin, corporate communicator, the leader or the leader's delegate managers.  

From the **Manage leaders** list, find the leader’s row and then select **Edit**. 

![View of Manage audiences page](/Viva/media/engage/IMG/manage-audiences-toggle.png)

On the **Manage audiences** page, configure the leader’s audiences. A leader can have up to two audiences:  

- **Entire organization**. The leader’s posts and announcements reach all users in the Viva Engage/Yammer network, excluding guests. To enable a leader to share and reach the entire organization, enable **Entire organization** toggle.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only Engage admins, Yammer verified admins, Yammer network admins and corporate communicators can allow leaders to reach the entire organization. Leaders and delegate managers cannot enable this toggle.  

- **Audience**. The audience represents people the leader wants to connect, communicate, and engage with most directly. This often means people in the leader’s immediate organization. To define an audience, search for and add users or groups.  

You can define a leader’s audience by adding individual users or groups (security or distribution groups). When you add a group, **changes to the group’s membership (including nested members) automatically update the audience**, within 24 hours. This makes it easy to apply existing groups that define a leader’s organization to define the leader’s audience in Viva Engage.  

Many customers have existing distribution lists used to communicate with an audience by email. They can simply add the same list(s) to the leader’s audience in Viva Engage. 

## Configure a leader’s delegates and delegate managers 

A leader’s communications (posts, stories and announcements) in Viva Engage can be created and managed by delegates. A *delegate* has permission to create posts and replies on behalf of another user. A *delegate manager* has the same ability to create content, and has additional capabilities—a delegate manager can configure the audience for a leader, and can assign additional delegates. 

A leader can configure delegates through the following steps: 

1. In Yammer, open the **Settings** menu (gear icon) in the top-right corner. 
2. Select **Manage delegate settings**. 

3. Add the name of the person who will be the delegate or delegate manager. 

4. Choose the type of delegate. 

- A delegate can create posts on behalf of the user in any public or private Yammer community as long as both the delegate and the user have access to it. 

- A delegate manager can similarly create posts. A delegate manager can also configure a leader’s audience, and assign additional delegates or delegate managers. 

- As soon as a user gets a new delegate assigned to the delegate team, the user and the whole team of delegates will receive an email notifying them of this action. 

- When a delegate is removed, the same audience is notified via email. 

5. If the delegate will create posts, stories, or announcements on the leader’s storyline, **enable the Storyline toggle**.

## What next 

**Announcements**

Learn more about announcements, which enable leaders to reach their audience with need-to-know information across Outlook, Teams, and Microsoft Viva. 

**Analytics**

Learn more about analytics for leaders, which empower leaders to measure and improve the effectiveness of their communication and engagement, and identify opportunities to drive impact.  

**Leadership Corner**

After a leader has been identified, the leader’s most recent activity on their storyline and in communities will become visible in Leadership Corner to people in the leader’s audience, or who follow the leader. Leadership Corner can be disabled using the toggle in the Viva Engage admin center by a global admin or Engage admin.
