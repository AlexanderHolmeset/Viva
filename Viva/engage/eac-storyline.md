# Manage and set up Storyline in Viva Engage 

Storyline empowers everyone within your organization to connect and contribute, while enabling your leaders to reach and engage employees. Through Storyline, people can share updates, experiences, and perspectives to reach followers and colleagues across the organization. On Storyline, there are two ways to share: posts and stories. Stories are short videos or photos that deliver a familiar, delightful way to catch up and stay connected with people across your organization. Engage with Storylines from the Web and the mobile applications you use every day: Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Microsoft Viva.

## Set up Storyline 

Global admins and Engage admins can manage Storyline for their organizations by selecting the Feature management tab within the Engage admin center, then selecting Storyline.  

>[!NOTE]
> Storyline must be enabled before you can enable stories.

## Enable Storyline

< Insert image of Storyline toggle >

Once chosen, admins will see the toggle which controls the availability of Storyline within your organization. When Storyline is enabled in your organization, it is available to all internal users who have access to Yammer and Viva Engage. All internal users will have their own Storyline feed on their profile page and will be able to see, react, and respond to others’ Storyline posts.  

>[!NOTE]
> Guests will not have their own Storyline and will not be able to see Storyline content from the internal users who do have access. 

When you disable Storyline, it removes the Storylines tab from all user profile pages and removes the Storylines landing page. Disabling Storyline prevents new Storyline conversations from starting, but does not delete any conversations that were posted prior to Storyline being disabled. Previously posted Storyline content can still be accessed through search and the Yammer Inbox by the people who participated in the Storyline conversation. Users who did not participate in the conversation will not have access after Storyline has been disabled. Storyline content will continue to be available through network data export and will be available through eDiscovery for networks that are in native mode.  

## Enable stories 

< Insert image of stories toggle >

Storyline must be enabled before stories can be enabled. If Storyline is disabled, stories will also be disabled and will not show up anywhere within the Viva Engage application. Stories are currently in public preview. This toggle is off by default and must be turned on to enable stories for public preview. When stories go to General Availability, it will be on by default unless Storyline is disabled in your organization or you choose to toggle it off. If stories are disabled with Storyline still enabled, the stories carousel on the home feed, Storylines landing page, and on the users’ individual Storyline pages will be removed. Disabling stories prevents new stories conversations from being started. Previously shared stories can still be accessed through Outlook and the Yammer or Viva Engage inbox by people who participated in the story. Note that this follows the same behavior as Storyline posts.
