# Overview of the Engage admin center

The following roles will have access to the Engage admin center within the Viva Engage app:  

- Global admin 
- Engage admin  
- Answers admin  
- Corporate communicator 

## Global admin 

This role has unlimited access to your organization’s settings and most of its data. Naturally, the global admin has permissions to perform all configurations for Viva Engage in your organization. Navigate [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide) to learn more about this role and security guidelines for assigning it.   

## Engage admin  

The Engage admin can set up and configure Engage for your organization and manage data, network related settings, and the various seeded or premium features within the application. The new role of Engage admin will be designated by [adding Yammer administrators in AAD](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/the-new-yammer-administrator-role-is-now-available-in-azure/ba-p/3592577). Yammer AAD administrators will automatically become Engage admins and they will have elevated permissions over end users. Tying the Engage admin to the Yammer administrator AAD role was intentional, since Viva Engage as an application is powered by Yammer technology.  

>[!NOTE]
> This admin role can be assigned and modified by a global admin through AAD, PIM, group based role assignments, or Azure portal and PowerShell.  

**Permissions**

The table below shows the range of actions available to Engage admin and Global admin based on their license. Admin permissions will be dependent on the users having the right licensing to configure those features.
