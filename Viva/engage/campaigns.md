# Campaigns in Microsoft Viva Engage 

Campaigns are an interactive way to drive employee engagement, with the power to build company culture, community, and belonging. Campaigns can be created, managed, and deleted by Global admins, Engage admins, and corporate communicators. 

## Set up a campaign

You can set up a campaign using the Campaign dashboard. To get there, go to the **Feature management** tab in the Engage admin center, and then select **Campaigns**.

The campaign dashboard provides a list of active, ended, and in-progress (draft) campaigns created for the organization.

## Create a campaign 

1. Select **Create campaign** from the top right corner of the campaign dashboard. 
2. Fill in the fields according to your campaign goals. **Campaign name** and **Campaign hashtag** are required to successfully create your campaign. The campaign name will only appear in the campaign management dashboard and the campaign hashtag will appear on the campaign landing page. **Default publisher** only supports discussion, question, praise, and poll type.
3. Select **Confirm** when you are ready to enter the draft state.

Campaign hashtags are used as the binding element for all campaign content, meaning any posted content containing the campaign hashtag will populate to the campaign landing page and will be included in campaign analytics.  

## Corporate communicator privileges

Corporate communicators can manage campaigns by:
- Publishing campaigns to be **Active** and viewable to all users in the network
- Setting **Active** campaigns to **Ended** once a campaign is finished
- Re-publishing **Ended** campaigns to be **Active** again for reoccurring campaigns
- Deleting campaigns that are not relevant or were made by mistake
- Updating certain assets on a campaign page such as the:
    - Goal tracker  
    - Executive sponsors
    - Cover photo
    - Pinning posts
    - Pinning resources and links
    - Updating theme colors
- View campaign analytics

## Publish or end a campaign

1. To publish a campaign, select the ellipses button (…) from the campaign management dashboard or directly from the campaign landing page.
2. Select **Publish campaign** to make the campaign **Active**.

Once a campaign is published, it becomes **Active** in the campaign management dashboard and the campaign landing page will be visible to anyone who selects a post or comment with the verified campaign hashtag. 

 

> [!NOTE]
> The three campaigns that populate to the **Active campaigns** module on the right navigation are ordered based on number of followers. Once a campaign is followed, it will no longer be visible in the **Active campaigns** module and will be replaced with a new campaign.  

Once a campaign has ended, the follow button and default publisher on the campaign landing page will be disabled. However, people can still post in communities and storylines using the campaign hashtag and those posts will accumulate in the campaign landing page.

## Build campaign awareness  

Users can access and discover campaigns through various methods.  

- **Verified Campaign Hashtag**
    - By selecting a post or comment that has the verified campaign hashtag, users will be routed to the campaign landing page where they can follow the campaign. Once a user follows a campaign, they will see **Followed campaigns** in the right rail of their profile page.  

Note: To build campaign awareness, campaign managers should share as many posts as possible with the campaign hashtag to their storyline and in communities. The campaign link can also be shared through posts, emails, and Microsoft Teams chats for users to easily access the campaign landing page. 

- **Active campaigns module**
    - On the home page, users will see an **Active campaigns** module on the right navigation. This will inform users of existing campaigns to follow.  

Note: Users can participate in any campaign from the Home feed, in a community, on a storyline, or from the campaign landing page by creating or commenting on a post using the campaign hashtag.

## Manage campaign analytics and engagement

Engage admins and corporate communicators have access to analytics that help monitor campaign engagement and improve future campaigns. Campaign analytics can be accessed from the campaign management dashboard and the campaign landing page.  

From the campaign management dashboard, select the graph icon in the right column under **Actions** to navigate to campaign analytics.
