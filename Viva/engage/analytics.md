# View and manage analytics in Viva Engage

Advanced analytic capabilities in Viva Engage help licensed users monitor their own engagement metrics (personal analytics). They enable leader to monitor their audience’s engagement (audience analytics), manage social campaign engagement (campaign analytics), and monitor engagement in Answers (answers analytics). To view analytics, select the analytics icon on the top navigation bar.

## Manage analytics

Any user with access to premium Viva Engage can access Engage Analytics. But only the *Microsoft 365 Global admin* and *Engage admin* roles can manage settings through the [Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).

In the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to enter the Engage admin center.

 The Global admin and Engage admin can configure, enable, and disable analytics features through the admin portal to tailor the experience for their organization: Go to the **Setup and configuration** tab in the Engage admin center and select **Manage analytics**.

>[!NOTE]
> Any leader’s delegates or delegate managers have visibility into the leader’s audience and personal analytics. A leader's audience must have at least *75 percent of users licensed* for audience analytics to be visible.

## Audience analytics  

In the **Manage analytics** interface shown earlier, the Engage admin can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that's available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience analytics** dashboard. This functionality enables unique levels of sentiment collection at the audience, theme, or conversation level.

Audience analytics help leaders and delegates monitor engagement within their audience on Viva Engage. Access is via the analytics icon on the top navigation bar or through the leader's storyline page.
