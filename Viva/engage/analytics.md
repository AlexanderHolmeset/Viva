# Analytics in Microsoft Viva Engage

Users with access to premium Viva Engage will be able to access Engage Analytics and manage settings via the Admin Center within the Viva Engage Teams app.   

## Manage analytics  

Premium analytic capabilities help licensed users monitor their own engagement metrics (personal analytics), leaders monitor their audience’s engagement (audience analytics), manage social campaign engagement (campaign analytics), and monitor engagement in Answers (answer analytics).  


Global admins and Engage admins can configure, enable, and disable analytics features via the admin portal to tailor the experience for their organization. To do this, navigate to the **Setup and configuration** tab within the Engage admin center and select **Manage analytics**.

## Manage Audience Analytics  

Engage admins can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that is available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience Analytics** dashboard. This allows for unique levels of sentiment collection either at the audience level, theme-level, or conversation level.  

## Manage Global Answers Analytics 
 
Engage admins can manage metrics for **Answers** within their organization once they have the knowledge license. They can choose to enable or disable:

- **Top contributors:** This displays top contributors who ask questions, post answers, and earn answer badges
- **Top badge earners:** This displays users who have earned the most badges across the organization  
- Advanced metrics like **time saved** and **people helped** to display impact  

## Access Personal Analytics  

All licensed users have access to analytics that help monitor the engagement on any of their posts in Viva Engage. Personal analytics can be accessed directly from the home feed and the storyline page of Engage.
