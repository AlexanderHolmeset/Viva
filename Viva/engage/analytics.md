# View and manage analytics in Viva Engage

Premium analytic capabilities in Viva Engage help licensed users monitor their own engagement metrics (personal analytics), leaders monitor their audience’s engagement (audience analytics), manage social campaign engagement (campaign analytics), and monitor engagement in Answers (Answers analytics).  

## Access analytics

While any user with access to premium Viva Engage will be able to access Engage Analytics, only Engage Admins will be able to manage settings through the Engage admin center.

Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to navigate to the [Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac.md).

## Manage analytics

Global admins and Engage admins can configure, enable, and disable analytics features via the admin portal to tailor the experience for their organization. To do this, navigate to the **Setup and configuration** tab within the Engage admin center and select **Manage analytics**.

>[!NOTE]
> Any leader’s delegates or delegate managers have visibility into the leader’s audience and personal analytics. A leader's audience must have at least 75% of users licensed in order for audience analytics to be visible.

## Manage Audience analytics  

Engage admins can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that is available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience Analytics** dashboard. This allows for unique levels of sentiment collection either at the audience level, theme-level, or conversation level.

## Manage Global Answers analytics

Engage admins can manage metrics for **Answers** within their organization once they have the knowledge license. They can choose to enable or disable:

- **Top contributors:** This displays top contributors who ask questions, post answers, and earn answer badges
- **Top badge earners:** This displays users who have earned the most badges across the organization  
- Advanced metrics like **time saved** and **people helped** to display impact  

## Access Personal analytics  

All licensed users have access to analytics that help monitor the engagement on any of their posts in Viva Engage. Personal analytics can be accessed directly from the home feed and the storyline page of Engage.

## Frequently asked questions 

**What does the scope of analytics include?** Personal analytics are based only on your posts in Viva Engage. 

**How often are analytics updated?** Analytics refresh daily (every 24 hours). If you don’t see changes reflected right away, check analytics the next day. 

**Where can users access Analytics from?** Analytics can be accessed from the right rail of your storyline page.

**Why can't my leader/delegate see audience analytics?** A leader and their delegate must be licensed users in order to view audience analytics. Additionally, at least 75% of the leader's audience must have a premium license for audience analytics to be visible to the leader or their delegate(s).
