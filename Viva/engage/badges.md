# Rewards and recognition admin controls in Viva Engage

## Rewards and recognition (R&R) admin controls  

Once assigned the Viva Engage Knowledge service plan, O365 (Global) admin and Engage admin will be able to configure Rewards and Recognition Answers badges through the Viva Engage Admin Center.

The Global and Engage admins will see three different options to have Answers badges **On**, **Disabled**, or based on **User preference**. 

- **Disabled**: data that was being collected for all users will be deleted and no further data will be collected for any users. The badges will be deleted as well.  
- **On**: users can start earning and collecting badges. The badges are visible to anyone who has a Viva Engage Knowledge service plan and who are part of the organization. 
- **User preference**: end users will have the option to turn off badges for themselves. When the user opts out, data that was being collected will be deleted and no further data will be collected. The user’s badges will be deleted but they will still be able to see others’ badges.
