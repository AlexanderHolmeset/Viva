# Introduction to Microsoft Viva Sales

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Sales is currently available only for public preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change.

Microsoft Viva Sales is a seller experience application that uses Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to automatically capture, access, and register data into any customer relationship management (CRM) system. It eliminates manual data entry and gives sellers more time to focus on selling. By enriching the data set with customer engagement data from Microsoft 365 and the power of AI, Viva Sales empowers sellers with sales intelligence that helps them deeply understand their customers for faster deal closure. Viva Sales is designed to help sellers boost productivity, lighten workloads, save time, and help salespeople sell more.
