# Administrator settings for Viva Sales

As a CRM administrator, you can customize Viva Sales as per your business requirements. For example, customizing the CRM information displayed in Viva Sales across Outlook and Teams.

You can access administrator settings from the Viva Sales app for Teams. The customization applies to the CRM environment you log in to Viva Sales from Outlook. If you want to customize Viva Sales in another environment, you must switch environments in Outlook.

When you open administrator settings, following tabs are available:

- **Home**: Serves as the landing page for the Viva Sales app.

- **Settings**: Contains all the settings for an administrator.

- **About**: Displays details of the Viva Sales app.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrator settings are visible only when you log in with your administrator credentials.

**To access administrator settings**

1.  Sign in to Microsoft Teams with your administrator credentials.

2.  In the app bar on the left, select **Viva Sales**.

    If **Viva Sales** is not visible, select **More added apps** (**…**), and then select **Viva Sales**.
