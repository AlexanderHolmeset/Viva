# Admin roles and tasks in Microsoft Viva
Setup and management of the Microsoft Viva suite starts with the Microsoft 365 admin. The Microsoft 365 admin can then assign additional roles for the management, tasks and maintenance of each Viva app.
Admin options and permissions for each app rely heavily on the environments the apps are available in. For example, most Viva apps are accessed through Microsoft Teams and rely on the Microsoft Teams permissions structure.

In this article, we bring together information on the types and levels of admin roles for each Viva app.

## Roles spanning Microsoft Viva apps

#### Microsoft 365 admin

The Microsoft 365 admin role spans the Viva suite. A Microsoft 365 admin sets up Viva, manages licenses and settings, and can assign the following Azure AD roles, which may be required for some apps and tasks:

- Viva Topics [Knowledge admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-manager)
- Viva Learning [Knowledge manager](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-administrator)
- Viva Insights [Business Leader](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-business-leader), [Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-administrator), and [Analyst](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-analyst)
- [SharePoint admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator)
- [Teams admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#teams-administrator)

#### Microsoft Teams admin

The Teams admin manages the Teams service and creates and manages Microsoft 365 Groups. Teams admins can access everything in the Microsoft Teams admin center and associated PowerShell controls.

For Viva, the Teams admin manages the [deployment of Viva apps](/microsoftteams/manage-apps) and some settings for the apps.

For more information, see [Use Microsoft Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles)

## Admin and management roles for each app

Deciding who should be assigned roles will partly depend on how much access you want a person to have.

For example, you might want to give someone site owner permissions so they can create and manage your Viva Connections dashboard. This person would also be able to manage permissions for that site, edit the home page and other pages, delete pages and other site contents, and more.

To help you decide who should be assigned which roles, here are overviews of roles for each app and what they do in Viva.<br><br>
