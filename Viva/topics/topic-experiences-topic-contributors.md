# Share knowledge and expertise in Microsoft Viva Topics

[Viva Topics](topic-experiences-overview.md) helps organizations make knowledge and expertise accessible to all employees. It’s like Wikipedia for organizations, but [artificial intelligence (AI) develops the first draft]() and subject matter experts edit the information to add their unique knowledge and expertise. Viva Topics then makes the knowledge available to colleagues and leaders at the time of need, and in the flow of their work. In this document we review:  

- [Showcasing knowledge and expertise with Viva Topics](topic-experiences-topic-contributors.md#showcase-knowledge-and-expertise-with-viva-topics)

- [Contributing to relevant topics](topic-experiences-topic-contributors.md#contributing-to-relevant-topics)

- [Editing and creating topics in Viva Topics](topic-experiences-topic-contributors.md#editing-and-creating-topics-in-viva-topics)

- [Getting help from colleagues](topic-experiences-topic-contributors.md#get-help-from-colleagues)

## Showcase knowledge and expertise with Viva Topics

We all have unique expertise and insight that are valuable to our peers and making our knowledge accessible to anyone in the organization has always been challenging. Viva Topics makes it easy to share knowledge and make it accessible for colleagues when they need it.

By sharing knowledge in Viva Topics, contributors will:

- Broaden their organizational impact by helping colleagues benefit from their contributions 

- Get recognized as a knowledge expert in the organization  

- Make new connections and lend expertise to colleagues who share similar interests  

Sharing knowledge can help peers within the organization spend less time searching for or recreating information and give time back to innovate more, learn more effectively, make better decisions, and improve how new team members get onboarded.  

Viva Topics uses AI to help organize an organization’s knowledge into shared topics. A topic is a phrase or term that has a specific meaning to the organization. Topics have resources related to them that can provide knowledge about the topic and help people find more information and experts related to the topic. There can be many different types of topics that may be important to an organization, including projects, products or services, materials or supplies, customers, suppliers, processes, disciplines, functions, and assets.  

The AI not only organizes knowledge into topics, it also automatically creates a suggested topic page for each. To take the knowledge base to the next level, people can easily add their tacit knowledge, provide unique insights, or generally improve the quality of the topic.  

When the context is appropriate, Viva Topics will suggest topics to be highlighted on all SharePoint modern site pages in a tenant. The topic can also be directly referenced on the SharePoint modern site page by a page author using a hashtag. Page authors can invoke the topic picker on a modern SharePoint page by adding a hashtag and then selecting the topic they’d like to include on the page.

When a user is curious to learn more about a topic, they can select the highlighted topic to view a Topic summary card that provides a short description. And if they want to learn more, they can select a Topic details link in the summary to open the detailed topic page. Any edits made, along with appearances in the people and suggested files and pages properties of the topic, are properly attributed to the author.

Additionally, users will also be able to find topics through Microsoft Search and Microsoft Office. Over time, Topics will be added to more places across Microsoft 365, including Teams, Yammer, and Outlook.  

## Contributing to relevant topics

There ar emultiple wasy to find relevant topics in the organization to contribute towards:

1. **Topic Center**: The Topic Center is the center of knowledge for the organization. It highlights the topics to which a user has a connection. There are two types of connections:  

**Suggested connections** - You will see topics listed under *We've listed you on these topics. Did we get it right?* These are topics in which a user’s connection to the topic has been suggested through AI based on contributions made to related files or sites. The user is asked to confirm whether they should stay listed as a related person for the topic. By responding to the confirmation request, the user is making Viva Topics better for themselves and the organization as a whole   

(IMAGE: TOPICS USER IS LISTED ON)

**Confirmed connections** - These are topics which users are pinned on the topic page or confirmed as a suggested connection to the topic. Topics will move from the suggested to confirmed section when they confirm a suggested connection.

2. **In the flow of work**: As content is read and stored in Microsoft 365, topics will be highlighted inline. When hovering over the topic name, more information will be shown in a topic card. There may be a prompt to provide feedback on topic cards and the user can then select the topic page and click the edit button on the top right of the topic page to [edit](topic-experiences-topic-contributors-.d#editing-and-creating-topics-in-viva-topics).

3. **Search**: If there is a specific topic to edit, the user can [search for it using Microsoft Search](search.md). If there is no existing topic in the tenant, a new topic can be created.

4. **Knowledge manager**: People in the organization may have taken on the role of knowledge manager and reached out to colleagues to get help curating specific topics. 

Only users who have the Who can create or edit topics permission link can edit or create a topic. If the user is unable to edit or create a topic, they can reach out to the admin to get the required permissions.  

## Editing and creating topics in Viva Topics

Each topic contains a consistent set of AI generated properties that can be edited.  

(IMAGE: PROPERTIES IF TOPICS THAT ARE AI GENERATED)

The properties are identified from the files and pages that are part of the evidence the AI gathered for identifying the topic. Alternate names and acronyms are sourced from these files and pages. The short description is sourced from these files and pages, or from the internet through Wikipedia. The source file, page, or Wikipedia article is referenced alongside the suggested properties. People are suggested based on their active contributions (for example, edits) to the files and pages. A reference to the number of contributions from a particular person provides a hint as to why the person has been identified. Files, pages, and sites are ranked based on whether they are central to the topic, or whether they can give an overview or introduction to the topic. 

It’s possible to improve the quality of topics in an organization by adding the correct alternate names and descriptions, and recommending people, files, pages, and related topics that are relevant for others in the company to learn more about the topic. 

Editing or creating a topic is like editing or publishing a SharePoint page. Learn how to [edit an existing topic](edit-a-topic.md). If the AI did not discover topics that are important to the organization, they can [create new topics](create-a-topic.md) in Viva Topics. Users can [save a topic as draft](save-topic-as-draft.md) if they are not ready to publish it.  

[!Note]
While information in a topic that is gathered by AI is [security trimmed](topic-experiences-security-trimming.md), the topic description and people information manually added when editing an existing topic is visible to all users who have permissions to view topics.

### Customizing a topic page

To accommodate different scenarios for how an organization may want to use Viva Topics, it’s possible to customize a topic page to include additional types of content – such as text, images, or links - beyond the standard properties of a topic. [Web parts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0) can be used on a topic page to bring in these different types of content.  

The appropriate web parts to use on a topic page will be based on the scenarios identified for Viva Topics. The [Viva Topics scenario catalogue](DOWNLOAD) can be referenced for some ideas. To help users think about different ways to make a topic page relevant to a scenario, consider sharing these sample scenarios and associated web parts that have been used on a topic page. These are just examples; users can choose what makes the most sense and be creative.

Remember to select **Publish** or **Republish** to save your changes. Republish will be the available option if the topic has been published previously. 

## Get help from colleagues

Most topics have multiple subject matter experts in an organization. To help improve the quality of the topics being curated, multiple employees should be consulted for help. If other employees who have experience, expertise, or passion about a certain topic are available, reach out and ask for their contributions.  

Employees who contribute their knowledge:  

- Broaden their impact by helping colleagues benefit from their contributions 

- Build their brand and get recognized for the knowledge they have about a topic 

Help colleagues curate topics effectively by:

- Sharing the specific topic(s) to be edited and [how to find other relevant topics](topic-center-overview.md#home-page) to curate  

- Helping them learn how to [edit](edit-a-topic.md) and [create](create-a-topic) new topics, and how to [save a topic as a draft](save-topic-as-draft.md)  

Users need **who can create or edit topics permissions** to be able to edit and create new topics. If colleague are unable to edit or create topics, they can reach out to the admin to have the appropriate [permissions assigned](topic-experiences-user-permissions.md).
