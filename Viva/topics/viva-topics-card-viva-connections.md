# Use Viva Topics cards in the Viva Connections Dashboard

Use Viva Topics cards to encourage knowledge discoverability, engagement, and sharing. Viva Topics has two different cards that can be used on the Viva Connections Dashboard. Viva Connections is a personalized employee experience that surfaces the most important content and tools from across your organization. Learn more about [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview) and [how to set up a Dashboard](/viva/connections/create-dashboard). 


>[!NOTE]
> Viva Topics cards will be generally available at the end of September 2022.


## Viva Topics cards
There are two separate Viva Topics cards for two separate intentions. 

### The Viva Topics Discover card

The Discover card can be used to view topics and knowledge areas for people who could be interested in learning more or contributing to a topic. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewer’s interests, current projects, and expertise. When viewers engage with the Discover card, they will be directed to the Topic center where they can learn more about topics and contribute (Edit an existing topic in Microsoft Viva Topics | Microsoft Docs). 

### The Viva Topics Share card

The Share card can be used to reach people who are known knowledge managers and are already engaged with topics and knowledge areas. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewers interests, current projects, and expertise. When viewers engage with the Share card, they will be directed to the Topics center where they can view and share topics.
