#  Viva Topics in Yammer

## Why are Yammer topics being migrated to Viva Topics? 
Microsoft is aligning to leverage the advantages of the capabilities of Viva Topics across all M365 apps and services. To ensure that Yammer customers can utilize the benefits of Viva Topics, we are integrating Viva Topics into Yammer experiences. To deliver this integration we are migrating Yammer topics to Viva Topics. There is no additional work needed by an organization to enable this migration. 

## Will all my Yammer topics be migrated to Viva Topics? 
 Yes, all Yammer Topics will be migrated to Viva Topics for the tenant. However, we care about the quality of topics that get surfaced in Yammer. Only Yammer Topics that were used in the last 18 months or are associated with 10 or more conversations will be available for selection in the Topic Picker experience.  

## We have heard that Viva Topics is a premium offering. Will migration require my organization to acquire Viva Topics licenses? 
There are many benefits of having Viva Topics licenses. However, for Yammer users to continue to have a seamless Topic experience post migration, there is no requirement for the users to have a paid Viva Topics license.  

## Does the experience of attaching Topics in Yammer conversations or questions change with this migration? 
From the user perspective, visibly, nothing. The Topic pills as they appear in conversations will continue to be available even after the migration. 

Regarding the quality of topics that get surfaced in Yammer, only Yammer Topics that were used in the last 18 months or are associated with 10 or more conversations will be available for selection in the Topic Picker experience. Attaching Yammer threads with Viva Topics will have the advantage of ensuring that Yammer content shows up across the M365 suite wherever the Viva Topics knowledge experiences surface. 

For Viva-licensed tenants, Yammer admins will go to a new destination called the Manage topics view to manage Yammer topics alongside all other Viva Topics. For unlicensed tenants, Yammer admins will use the same controls as before to manage topics in Yammer. 

## What are some of the key differences in the Yammer experience that end users will notice after the migration? 
The one key experience difference that users will observe is that Topic cards will start appearing when hovering over a Topic pill. Users with a Viva Topics license, when they load the topic feed for a given topic, will be able to view the topic in Topic center. 

> [!Note] 
> Topic card experience is available only to users who have been assigned a Viva Topics license. 

## Can I use the migrated topics in other M365 apps and services? 
Yes, migrated topics can be seen in other M365 apps and services. The Knowledge manager will have to confirm the migrated topics 

## How will permissions be affected by the migration? 
To not disrupt the end user experience, permissions for the Yammer experience will remain the same. Users will be able to create/view/edit topics like they are used to. Topic access can be controlled in the Microsoft Admin Center, as a part of the broader Viva Topics product.
