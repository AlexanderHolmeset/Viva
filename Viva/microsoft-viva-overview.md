# Microsoft Viva overview

Microsoft Viva is an integrated employee experience platform built within Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams that gives you the ability to support connection, insight, purpose, and growth in your organization using your existing infrastructure.

Viva is easily customizable and extensible, accessible from anywhere you work, and supports several partner integrations to give you access to industry-leading apps in the natural flow of work.
