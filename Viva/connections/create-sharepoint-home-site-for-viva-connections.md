# Create a SharePoint home site for Viva Connections

Use this guided walkthrough if you're creating a home site so your organization can use Viva Connections. Get guidance on how to create a cohesive experience between the desktop and mobile apps. Before you start, learn more about [planning home site content](home-site-plan.md) and [how to launch a healthy portal](/sharepoint/portal-health).

Don’t have time to create a home site from scratch? Consider using [the Landing site template from the SharePoint look book](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/c9300e94-6e83-471a-b767-b7878689e97e) and then add the [Dashboard web part](use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site.md) and the [Feed web part](use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Only SharePoint admins can set sites as a home site.  

### How to use this guide

The web parts used here pair well with home sites, however web parts can be swapped or left out. Decide what is best for your organization and adjust the layout as needed.

The guidance here will help you design the home site and customize web parts, but you'll need to provide your own content. 

A home site needs site navigation that is organized well, highlights popular resources and portals, and is relevant to the entire organization. This design guidance doesn't specifically talk about how to design site navigation. Get more guidance on [how to think about links in home site navigation](/sharepoint/information-architecture-models-examples) and [in the global navigation](sharepoint-app-bar.md).

## Summary of the site structure
This home site design uses a vertical section and a combination of one and two column sections. After [creating your communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb#:~:text=Steps%20to%20create%20a%20communication%20site%3A%201%20Sign,5%20Give%20your%20new%20communication%20site%20a%20name), start by [laying out the sections](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899) before adding web parts.

## Build this site 
Start with a [modern SharePoint communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb#:~:text=Steps%20to%20create%20a%20communication%20site%3A%201%20Sign,5%20Give%20your%20new%20communication%20site%20a%20name). Next, [start adding sections](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899)following the diagram in the site sections summary. Then, add and edit web parts. The guidance for customizing web parts can be applied when you are in edit-mode for each web part.

## Customize site details

After the site has been built out, edit site details to create a customized design that aligns with your organizations brand and identity. These [site details can be managed](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b#:~:text=1%20Customize%20the%20theme.%20You%20can%20change%20the,links%20on%20your%20site%20navigation.%20For%20more%20) from **Settings** > **Change the look**.

**Theme** – Select a theme that is ideal for the entire organization. If you make your home site [a hub site](/sharepoint/dev/features/hub-site/hub-site-overview), this theme will get passed down to sites that associate with the hub.

**Header** – Use the Compact header layout to reproduce the same look as this home site.

**Logo** – Select a logo that is recognizable to the entire organization.
    
**Footer** – Footer navigation is optional and can be used to highlight popular portals and resources. 


## Best practices before launching your new home site

- A home site is used by the entire organization, so the site needs to be [inclusive and easily accessible on all devices](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-ready-build-an-accessible-sharepoint-site-3a1df3ad-f093-450c-85a6-b3bf70fd6abb)and potentially [need to be viewed in other languages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-multilingual-communication-sites-pages-and-news-2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c).

- The home site will be viewed by a high volume of users. Make sure you [manage site performance](/sharepoint/portal-health)through the planning and building phases.

- Before launching the home site broadly, test the site with a handful of users to make sure key tasks and resources are readily accessible and fully functioning. 

- Consider using the [Portal launch scheduler](/microsoft-365/enterprise/portallaunchscheduler) to help you follow a phased roll-out approach by batching viewers in waves and managing the URL redirects for the new portal.

## Next: Enable and set up global navigation

Once you’ve set a communication site as a home site, you'll be able to [enable and set up global navigation in the SharePoint app bar](sharepoint-app-bar.md). Global navigation can be set up while you're designing your home site and is a requirement for Viva Connections. Resources highlighted in the global navigation [will appear in the “Resources” tab in the Viva Connections mobile app](viva-connections-overview.md).
