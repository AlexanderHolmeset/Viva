# Step 3: Build Viva Connections for your organization

After the planning phase for Viva Connections is the building phase. Once you’ve got a home site, global navigation set up, and a plan, you are ready to create the Viva Connections Dashboard. Then, you will select settings for the mobile app. Next, you will make sure content that’s on the home site, and linked to cards on the Dashboard can be accessed by the right audiences and offers the ideal viewing experience. Lastly, you will test and refine the experience before launching to the rest of the organization. 

## Create a Viva Connections Dashboard
The Dashboard brings it all together – it provides a personalized landing experience and is designed to be the central destination where everyone can discover your organization's resources and complete daily tasks. 

[Apply audience targeting](/viva/connections/create-dashboard#apply-audience-targeting-to-cards) to Dashboard cards to give your users an experience tailored to their role and interests. Once you set up the Dashboard, you will be able to use the [Dashboard web part](/SharePoint/use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site). Consider using the Dashboard web part on the home site or other high-traffic portals.


## Enable the Viva Connections app in the Microsoft Teams admin center and choose mobile settings
After you have prepared your intranet for Viva Connections in SharePoint, you are ready to [add the Viva Connections app in the Microsoft Teams Admin Center](/viva/connections/add-viva-connections-app). Add the Viva Connections app, and then customize app settings to add your organization's logo, pre-install, and pre-pin the app for end users.

The Viva Connections app creates a custom app in Microsoft Teams that fits the needs of your organization. Your organization’s custom app will appear as a branded company app in the Microsoft Teams app center. Once the app is added, your organization’s icon will appear in the Teams app bar in the desktop and mobile Microsoft Teams experience. Users won’t see the app by default if you don’t pre-install and pre-pin. [Learn more about app setup policies in the Teams admin center](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies#:~:text=Arrange%20the%20apps%20in%20the%20order%20that%20you,to%20appear%20in%20Teams%2C%20and%20then%20select%20Save.).


## Ensure high-traffic content can be accessed by the right users and provides an ideal viewing experience
As a first step, [test the performance of the home site](/sharepoint/portal-health) to ensure an optimal viewing experience. Then, check the performance for SharePoint sites that will receive a high amount of traffic. For example, sites that relate to human resources, organizational news, and popular services like transportation or café menus. Then, [share the home site with the entire organization](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-a-site-958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658) before launching. Next, make sure that the target audiences for the cards in the Viva Connections Dashboard are shared with the right audiences. 




## Test and refine the Viva Connections experience
Before sharing Viva Connections with the rest of your organization, recruit a small group of users to test and refine popular workflows to ensure end-users have a great experience using Viva Connections for the first time. Consider recruiting specific people from difference audiences to complete popular tasks. Make improvements until the experience is ideal for the rest of the organization.

**Best practices for testing:**
- Use the approved web browser for your organization
- Test Viva Connections on a desktop device and mobile device
- Make sure all the links are active and there aren’t any dead ends
- Pay attention to labels on Dashboard cards and buttons – will they make sense to the rest of the organization?
- Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of icons and images
- Check for performance issues like slow loading times or missing images
- Ask testers about the [navigation experience](/sharepoint/information-architecture-modern-experience)
- Test with early adopters and champions and capture their feedback


## Next, launch Viva Connections for your organization
