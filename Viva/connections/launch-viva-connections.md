# Step 4: Launch Viva Connections for your organization
After planning, building, and testing Viva Connections, it’s time to let the rest of the organization know that its available for use. 

**Consider using the following tactics to spread the news:**

- **Announce your organization’s instance of Viva Connections at an event:** Kick off the announcement about the availability of Viva Connections at an all-hands (or sometimes called a Town Hall) meeting where everyone in the organization will attend or can view a recording later. 
- **Use communication tools like SharePoint news and Yammer communities:** Share details about the Viva Connections launch along with any change management guidance or end-user training in an [organizational news post](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7#:~:text=In%20SharePoint%20Online%2C%20you%20can%20add%20news%20posts,instructions%20Create%20the%20news%20post%20.%20See%20More), [Yammer communities](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-a-conversation-in-yammer-da65b1c3-6651-4141-8dbd-d50d61b98a6e), and [Microsoft Teams channels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-format-a-post-e66777da-636b-49eb-9408-b0d88b212885).
- **Consider hosting training events or offering office hours:** Make sure end-users get the most from Viva Connections by offering ongoing support the first 30 days after launching.
