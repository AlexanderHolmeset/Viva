## Shared responsibility model
Microsoft works to ensure that we are compliant with industry and international standards, and customers are responsible for ensuring their data within the Microsoft Cloud is protected in a manner that is compliant with the standards and regulations imposed on the customer.

## Inheritance of compliance features and settings
Microsoft Viva apps are built on your existing infrastructure and, depending on the app, inherit compliance features and settings from Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Azure, Yammer and Microsoft Graph.

## System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2

A SOC 2 report is an independent assessment of a service organization's systems and processes that are relevant to the trust services criteria. The report is conducted by a third-party auditor and evaluates the effectiveness of the controls in place to meet these criteria. 
Following is the SOC 2 audit report status for each Viva app:
