# Search preference settings

Learning admins and knowledge admins with Viva Learning premium licenses can set search preference settings for a customized content experience for users in their organization. 

## Prioritized provider

Use the **Prioritized provider** settings to prioritize content based on providers spaces where users can search on Viva Learning.

The setting is set to **None** by default. You can choose any one provider from the list of all available providers in the tenant. After confirming the provider selection, all content from the chosen provider is prioritized for Viva Learning users in your organization.

Prioritization is visible in the following Viva Learning spaces: 

- Home page 
    - **Browse by** section 
    - **Interests** section 
- **Search results** page 
- all search options in the Admin tab and Learning collection
- **Related courses** section in the Learning content details page 

Updates to this setting are reflected immediately to all users and spaces. 

> [!NOTE] 
> - Provider-based content prioritization boosts the provider content when compared to no prioritization.  
> - Provider-based content prioritization doesn't guarantee that the providerâ€™s content is always visible to users. It also depends on user query and information (Title, Description, SkillTags and Keywords) available on Learning content. 
> - Provider-based content prioritization is only applicable to Viva Learning spaces. Search in M365 surfaces isn't impacted by this setting.


### Guidelines for choosing a Provider 

As an admin, you can choose to prioritize a provider for any of these cases: 

- Tenant creates proprietary Learning content for its users under this provider
- Provider content is important for Viva Learning Users
- Provider content is preferred by the Learning Admin
- Provider content is preferred by Most of the employees
