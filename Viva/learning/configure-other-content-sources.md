# Add other content providers for Microsoft Viva Learning

A growing set of learning content providers are available through Viva Learning. This set may change at any time as more providers join or change their status with the program.

Some learning sources will be enabled by default and will be available without a premium Viva Learning license. These learning sources include:

- LinkedIn Learning select 125 courses
- Microsoft Learn
- Microsoft 365 Training

Third-party content sources are not enabled by default. To enable these sources, you will need to [add them in the Microsoft 365 admin center](content-sources-365-admin-center.md#configure-settings-for-the-learning-content-sources) and follow the specific instructions shown in the following table.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need a Viva Learning or Viva Suite license to access this feature. [Learn more about licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/learning).

>[!NOTE]
>It can take 24 to 48 hours for Viva Learning users to see content for the sources you enabled in the admin portal. It can also take 24 to 48 hours to hide content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn and Microsoft 365 trainings from Viva Learning after you have disabled them in the admin portal.

## Dataflow architecture

The dataflow diagram illustrates how Viva Learning ingests third-party content. The third-party provider is the ultimate source of information for content records for their customers. Viva Learning extracts the content from the third-party provider using the connector.

<!-- infographic here-->

The step-by-step content ingestion process is described below.

1. **Third-party provider** <br> Viva learning requires content catalog data from every third-party content source. The various fields extracted as part of the Content Catalog package or API from the content source are represented in the table [View the table](#content-catalog-metadata-fields).

2. **Third-party Connector** <br> The third-party Connector pulls content from the content provider using both API and SFTP mechanisms. The first time you sync, the third-party extractor pulls the full data. Afterwards, a scheduler triggers once every 24 hours to refresh the data and pull any changes. Then the extract is validated and processed. In case of any error in processing, the error code displays on the admin portal. User records received from the extract are mapped with Azure Active Directory (AAD) records to ensure the correct assignment and completion status for every user. Once all the records are processed, the data is synchronized to Viva learning application and displayed on the Viva Learning app.

3. **Viva Learning** <br> Content details (content provider logo, thumbnail, title, description, etc.) display on the **Home** and **Learning** tabs in Viva Learning.
