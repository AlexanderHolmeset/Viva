Track the current sync status, last successful sync time, ingestion logs, and trigger full sync for each component in the expanded view:

- **Sync status and timestamp**: Check the current sync status (success/failed/in progress) of content, learner record sync, and catalog permissions sync for a specific source.
First time configurations display the default sync stamp of 1/1/1

- **Manual sync trigger**: Trigger the full sync manually for a delta or full sync. Once a full sync is triggered, the current sync status will be updated accordingly.

- **Export log**: Admins can refer to the **export log file** for a summary of details successful or failed sync cycles.

> [!NOTE]
> The sync status, sync time stamp and export logs are only currently available for catalog sync for all providers. 
Sync status and sync timestamp for learner records are only available for SAP SuccessFactor. Manual sync trigger is only available for catalog in SharePoint and SAP SuccessFactor.
