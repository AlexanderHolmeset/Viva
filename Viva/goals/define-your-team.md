Much like an orchestra, a successful OKR rollout requires a solid team working together in concert to have a great performance.

## Key OKR stakeholders and their functions

The entities that are the key OKR (Objective and Key Result) stakeholders are described in the following table:


|Entity Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|OKR champion     |    This entity is responsible for spearheading the adoption of the OKR framework within an organization, communicating its value, and driving progress from the top.     |
|Viva Goal administrator     |     This entity is responsible for managing the implementation process from end to end, in the project.    |
|Technical contact   |     This entity is responsible for helping with software integrations, sign-on decisions, permissions and security, and other technical questions.    |
|Team leader    |     This entity is a leader of a team - from C-level executives and senior leadership to directors and department managers - and owns objectives and goals for the company.    |
|Individual team members    |    This entity refers to the individual employees within a company; sometimes, such employees have direct ownership of Kky results, and at other times are simply observers to organization goals.     |

> [!NOTE]
> In smaller companies, these positions often overlap. For example, the OKR champion is also a senior leader, or the Viva Goal administrator handles technical implementation.
