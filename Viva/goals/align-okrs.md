# Align OKRs

## How to align OKRs across your organization

Alignment is one of the most powerful features of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). By aligning your objectives at an individual, team and organization level, strategically aligned OKRs rapidly get everyone on the same page, working towards results that matter.

Viva Goals visually signifies alignment with a line. You can see all the key results nested under an objective on the Objective page, and under the **OKRs** tab in the organization, team and individual views.

What this line shows us is how OKRs at the team and individual level contribute to larger Objectives further upstream and laterally. All OKRs are visible to everyone in the organization, so each individual knows where goalposts are and what needs to be done to achieve success. 

### How to align objectives 

1. To align an objective to another objective, click on **More** within your objective. From the drop-down, select **Align Objective**.

1. When searching for objectives to align to, you can **search** for objectives, teams, owners, or time periods in the search bar or choose from the **suggested time periods and entities**. Select the objective you want to align to and click **Save**.
1. View and edit the added alignment from the Quick View page.

If you need to un-align objectives at any time, you can also do so from the **Full View** page. Find the **Edit Alignment** box on the right-hand side, remove the alignment and save it.

### How to edit alignment

1. To edit alignment, click on **Edit Alignment**.

2. When searching for objectives to align to, you can search or filter OKRs by entity and time period to narrow your results. In this example, to search for company OKRs, you would select **Digital Tones entity**.

3. Hover over the objective you want to align to and click **Align** then **Done**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can expand an objective to show KRs below and align to those, as well.

4. View and edit the added alignment on the Objective Detail page.

## How to update progress on your objectives  

The roll-up of status and progress through the alignment chain makes it easy to see the impact a key result has on its parent objective and other objectives in the OKR hierarchy. 

- **If progress is tracked based on % completed, Viva Goals will automatically update the status and progress of parent objectives based on the progress of the key results.** The value of progress on the objective will be the average of the progress of its key results.

- **If the objective is tracked by a success metric like a KPI, Viva Goals won't attempt to convert percentages into your chosen success metric.** The owner of the objective can manually update the progress with a check-in and enter a value.

- **Once all key results are complete, the objective will automatically be marked as complete.** The average score of the key results will become the score of the objective.

### The 3 ways of updating progress on your objectives 

Engaging everyone with company goals and driving OKR adoption is the primary responsibility of OKR champions and team managers. Better visibility into how progress is updated will help you understand the user engagement with objectives. 

Progress mode indicates how the progress of an OKR is updated. There are three modes of updating progress.

|Mode  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Manually     |  Progress of the objective will be determined by the objective owner through a registration made manually.        |
|Automatic via rollup from children     |     Progress of the objective will be rolled up automatically from the key results.     |
|Automatically from a data source     |     Progress of the objective will be updated automatically based on the data from an integration.     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Projects in Viva Goals, you can check-in on progress with these projects manually. When you switch to the automatic mode, progress will roll up from tasks beneath Projects. These tasks can either be added in Viva Goals directly, or through an integration. 

### How to set the progress mode for an OKR

**When creating or editing your objective:** When you create or edit an objective, you can determine how the progress will be updated. If your objective is measured by percent of completion, you'll have three progress modes to choose from â€” manually, automatic via roll-up from children, automatically from a data source. However, if your objective is measured with a KPI, you won't be able to update the progress via roll-up because we don't want to override the metric. You''ll have to automate the update through an integration, or register manually.

**From the list view:** The icon to the left of the progress bar is indicative of the progress mode. You can select the icon to change the progress mode, or you can make a registration instantly by leveraging the slider progress bar.

**When making a registration:** If the progress of your objective is updated automatically, you can make a registration and switch to the manual progress mode in which case, the automatic progress will be overridden by the manual registration. You can always switch back to previous progress mode to resume updating the progress automatically from the children or the connected data source.

**If the progress is rolled up automatically from the key results, perform the following steps:**

1. Select the rollup icon and select the **Check-in** button.
1. Make a registration as you see fit and save it. You'll notice the change in the icon that represents the manual mode.
1. To switch back to the previous mode, select the manual icon and select the **Check-in** button.
1. Save this registration as you'll have the option to resume updating the progress from key results.

**If the progress is rolled up automatically through an integration, perform the following steps:**

1. Select the integration icon and select the **Check-in** button.
1. Make a registration as you see fit and save it. You'll notice the change in the icon that represents the manual mode.
1. To switch back to the previous mode, select the manual icon and select the **Check-in** button.
1. Save this registration as you'll have the option to resume updating the progress through the connected data source.

### How to set check-in reminders

If you switch an OKR or a Project into the manual override progress mode, you will receive check-in reminders for as long as the OKR or Project stays in manual mode. Once you revert it to the automated progress mode, whether by rollup or integration, you will no longer receive reminders to check-in.
