## How to align OKRs across your organization

Alignment is one of the most powerful features of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). By aligning your objectives at an individual, team and organization level, strategically aligned OKRs rapidly get everyone on the same page, working towards results that matter.

Viva Goals visually signifies alignment with a line. You can see all the key results nested under an objective on the Objective page, and under the **OKRs** tab in the organization, team and individual views.

What this line shows us is how OKRs at the team and individual level contribute to larger Objectives further upstream and laterally. All OKRs are visible to everyone in the organization, so each individual knows where goalposts are and what needs to be done to achieve success. 

### How to align objectives 

1. To align an objective to another objective, click on **More** within your objective. From the drop-down, select **Align Objective**.

1. When searching for objectives to align to, you can **search** for objectives, teams, owners, or time periods in the search bar or choose from the **suggested time periods and entities**. Select the objective you want to align to and click **Save**.
1. View and edit the added alignment from the Quick View page.

If you need to un-align objectives at any time, you can also do so from the **Full View** page. Find the **Edit Alignment** box on the right-hand side, remove the alignment and save it.

### How to edit alignment

1. To edit alignment, click on **Edit Alignment**.

2. When searching for objectives to align to, you can search or filter OKRs by entity and time period to narrow your results. In this example, to search for company OKRs, you would select **Digital Tones entity**.

3. Hover over the objective you want to align to and click **Align** then **Done**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can expand an objective to show KRs below and align to those, as well.

4. View and edit the added alignment on the Objective Detail page.
