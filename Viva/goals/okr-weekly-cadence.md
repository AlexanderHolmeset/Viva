So you've your OKRs set, the organization is aligned and you've made your first check-ins. Whats Next?

One of the most important parts of the OKR process is developing a weekly cadence to update, review, and track progress of your OKRs. 

We advise incorporating these items into your weekly stand up or team meetings that exist today. 

Setting aside 15 minutes to discuss OKRs once a week will go a long way in OKR adoption and buy-in for your organization. 

## Step 1: Update your OKRs

Ensure your OKRs have the latest information to discuss. Having check-in notifications set up will help keep your team up to date. You can learn more about setting up these notifications [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications). It's best to have these notifications go out at least 24 hours in advance of your scheduled meeting where you'll be discussing OKRs. This way your team can come ready to the meeting with everything up to date.

## Step 2: Review OKRs with the team

In your meetings, discuss the OKRs of the party involved. Identify any that may have been marked Behind or At Risk in the past week and drill-in to understand the details. Additionally you can leave Kudos and Comments directly on OKRs, more on that [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2107055-check-ins-and-feedback). We recommend using the [Chart View](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2375435-chart-view) for these meetings as it will allow you to quickly identify the status of OKRs in a visually pleasing format

## Step 3: Compare progress to previous week

Our "compare to previous" tool is a great trending feature that'll allow you to quickly identify what is moving forward or OKRs that have stalled progress. This tool is a great tool to utilize in your weekly review meetings. With two clicks of a button, you've that information at your finger tips. See instructions for enabling this view [here.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2632032-compare-to-past).

## Step 4: Adjust as necessary

If everything is moving along as expected, great! If not, remember OKRs sometimes need adjustments and that is okay. Make any [edits](https://help.ally.io/articles/3065314-q-can-i-edit-or-delete-a-okr) and reset expectations moving forward. 

That's it! 

In 15 minutes, you've gained a clear picture into: what has moved forward, what's behind, and what has been changed for the coming week for the critical aspects of the business. Comments and Kudos have been left and most importantly your team knows you're tracking their progress, you care about their work, and they can see how it's contributing throughout the company.

Ideally, this transparency is happening at all levels of the company: Organization, Departments, Teams and any Sub-Teams. Each owner of the level would meet with the direct members below, however it may take some time to get all levels involved and that is okay. With each cycle, the number of people wanting to be involved increases.

If you keep this regular rhythm, there's no telling how far OKRs can take you.
