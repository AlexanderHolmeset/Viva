# Define KR Types in Viva Goals

The new KR types enable users to establish goals with defined outcomes. These KR types can be simple quantity-type KRs that measure progress from one point to another. Or, they can be guardrail (quality-type) KRs that help monitor consistency and efficiency of businesses.  

## What are the different KR types you can create in Viva Goals? 
Viva Goals allows you to create 5 distinct types of KRs (For Key Results in Classic and for both Objectives and Key Results in Duality); we are broadly classifying them into two main categories: 

1. Regular KR types (Quantity KRs)  

2. Control KR types (Quality/Guardrail KRs):  

### Regular KR types (Quantity): 
1. **Reach:** 
  The 'Reach' metric type is useful when you have a specific target that you want to achieve, for example, "Conduct 5 internal surveys" or "Launch 4 Kitchens".

2. **Increase from:**
  When the OKR is required to track a metric which is already at a certain number and must increase to a higher number such as “Increase revenue from $20Mn to $40mn this year”, you can choose the 'Increase from' metric. Here, the ‘from’ indicates the starting value of $20Mn and the ‘to’ indicates the target value of $40Mn.  

3. **Decrease from:**
  Similarly, when the OKR is required to track a metric which is already at a certain number and must decrease further to a lower number, you can select the ‘Decrease from’ metric type. E.g., “Reduce P0 bugs from 50 to 10 this quarter”. Here, the start value is the higher value of 50 and the target value is the lower value 10.  

### Control KR types (Quality) 
Control KR types are useful when you must keep your OKRs above or below a certain threshold value. For instance, “Keep CSAT score above 9”.  

Viva Goals has 2 control metrics:  

1. **Stay below:**

When teams are setting up their quarterly/annual OKRs, along with the quantity metrics such as revenue, they would also like to set up guardrail metrics. These metrics help in maintaining quality. 

For example, “Keep churn less than $100k”. Here, the input is only the target value which acts as a threshold and the metric is always tracked to stay below this threshold.

2. **Stay above:** 

Similarly, when the OKR is required to track a metric to help maintain quality such as “Keep NPS above 9” the stay above KR type can be used. Here, the input is only the target value which acts as a threshold.  

## How can you set KR types for a Key Result?

1. Add a key result by selecting '...' and then choosing the **Add a Key Result** option from the menu.
