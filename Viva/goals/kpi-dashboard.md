# Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals' KPI Dashboard feature allows users to view one, or many, KPIs in a single dashboard.

If your organization has the KPI Dashboard enabled, it will be found on all dashboards in Viva Goals and can be configured differently for each entity or team.

## Dashboard Makeup

The KPI dashboard will contain all top level objectives that are set as KPIs for that entity. It will display the alignment (if it exists), the current status given at last check-in, and the current value. It will also show the amount increased from the start value in small grey text.

## Who can Manage These Dashboards?

The KPI dashboard can be managed by anyone who has admin permissions for the view.

A Viva Goals admin or Organization owner can manage the Organization level dashboard.

Team owner or team admin can manage their team's dashboard.

Individual contributors can manage their dashboard for owned Objectives.

## Add more KPIs to the Dashboard

If an objective has key results below it, or there are other key results, set as KPIs, users can manually add those to the dashboard with the action button.

There's no limit on the number of KPIs you can include on the dashboard, however, we suggest that only the business's most critical KPIs be included to maintain an easy to understand view.

## Remove KPIs from the Dashboard

To remove a KPI from the dashboard, you can select the gear on the dashboard itself or **Remove from KPI Summary** in the action dropdown.

## Rearrange KPIs on the Dashboard

To move a KPI tile to another location on the dashboard, drag and drop it to the new position. The previous KPIs will move up to fill the space in a left to right manner.
