# Drag and Drop: Reordering OKRs

> [!IMPORTANT]

With Viva Goals' drag-and-drop feature, you can quickly reorder your OKRs.

**How to Drag and Drop**

To drag and drop an objective, perform the following steps:

1. Hover your mouse left of the objective name until you see the display of the icon depicted in the following image:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/display-of-icon.png" alt-text="Display of icon":::

2. Click and hold your cursor to grab the objective.

3. Drag it to the desired location and alignment.

To make an objective become a key result, drag the cursor to the **+ Add key result** icon under the objective.

You can just as easily drag a key result out from under an objective to make it become an objective itself. Both examples are covered in the video below.

> [!NOTE]
> Drag-and-drop is available at the organizational, team, and individual levels.

### OKR model configuration settings and how it impacts drag and drop

1. You can drag a key result under an objective to make it an objective only when you have enabled the **Objectives and key results can be used interchangeably** option in the Admin Dashboard.
1. If you've selected the **Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option in the Admin Dashboard, you can drag an objective and drop it under a key result when you have additionally enabled the **Allow objectives to be nested under key results** settings.
1. You can drag a key result and drop it to nest it under another key result only when you've enabled the **Allow key results to be nested under key results** option in the Admin Dashboard.
