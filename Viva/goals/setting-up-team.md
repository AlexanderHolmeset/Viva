1. Select the **Add Members** button. The user is added to the team as a member.

To add people who are currently not in Viva Goals, you can use the same dialog box. Ensure the **Send invitations to users who are not in Viva Goals** checkbox is checked.

As part of setting up a team, it is useful to have another team administrator to ensure that the team setup process is not dependent on one person.

To assign permissions of a team administrator to a team member, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Team Members** tab

   For every user listed, there is an **Actions** dropdown list in the last column.

1. Select the **Actions** dropdown list and select **Promote to Team Admin**.
