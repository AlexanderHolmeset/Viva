By default, OKR periods are set up quarterly in Microsoft. and they're managed automatically by Viva Goals. For example, when a quarter ends and a new quarter begins, Viva goals will automatically set the current period for everyone in your organization to the new quarter. All users can see the period has changed to the new quarter when the **Active Period OKRs** reflect OKRs from the current active period.

As a Viva Goals administrator for your organization, you can manage the OKR Periods and customize them as per your organization's requirements. Instead of the default quarterly periods, you can make it monthly or define a custom time period you want, and remove the default quarterly periods. 

To manage time periods:

1. Navigate to the **Time Periods** section in your admin dashboard. Select and save the month when your planning year starts. It is set to January by default.

## FAQs:

### When are the time periods for my next planning year created? 

The time periods for the next planning year(annual and quarterly) will be automatically created in Viva Goals on the first day of the fourth quarter(Q4) for your current planning year.

If you have already started planning for your next year's OKRs before Q4, you can add the next year time periods from the **Admin > Time Periods dashboard** and start adding your OKRs right away!

### How to set custom time period for OKRs?

OKR Periods are set to quarters by default in Viva Goals and they're managed automatically by Viva Goals. For example, when a quarter ends and new quarter begins, Viva Goals will automatically set the current period for everyone in your organization to the new quarter. In addition to this, the Viva Goals administrator(s) can manage the OKR Periods. Instead of the default quarterly periods, administrators can make it monthly or any custom time period they want for their organization by adding those OKR periods, and removing the default quarterly periods.

While creating an OKR, you can set the Time Period according to the quarter or time period the corresponding objective belongs to. You can also change this by altering the start and end dates of the period.

Example: If you want to create an annual objective but make it due on October, you can set the end date accordingly.
