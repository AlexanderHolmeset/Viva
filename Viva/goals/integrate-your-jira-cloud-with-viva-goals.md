## Introduction to Jira integration 

Jira is where everyday work happens for most product teams, and it becomes difficult for them to connect the work they do with the company goals. To understand how their work is moving the needle on the company goals, they need to switch back and forth to keep their OKRs current, and connect their everyday work to the bigger vision and goals. 

To plan every sprint effectively, and ensure product teams focus on things that matter, it's important to give them the bigger picture at the comfort of their Jira instances. Download Viva Goals app for your Jira Cloud instance from the Atlassian marketplace to let your product teams connect their work in Jira to company goals in Viva Goals, without having to leave Jira.

Examples of how teams, and individuals can benefit out of this integration:

1. An engineering manager uses the **Link as a project** feature in JIRA to create a project in Viva Goals, once the linking is done at a parent level, all its children also get connected to the same project. As and when there's progress on the parent or the children, the progress and status of the projects automatically is updated.

2. A senior engineer or a product manager who runs specific projects from JIRA, can now see how his teamâ€™s execution moves the needle on an OKR by viewing the status and progress of the project within JIRA.

## Setting up the app 

Users can install the Viva Goals app from Atlassian marketplace. Once the app is configured, users who have access to Jira will be able to access Viva Goals from each Jira issue. This way, you can create projects in Viva Goals from within Jira. 

1. Search for the Viva Goals OKR app from the JIRA marketplace, once you have found the app you can start the installation process.

2. After the app is installed successfully, you'll receive a message stating that the app has been installed. Select **Manage Apps** section after installation you'll be navigated to the [Viva Goals](https://ally.io/) app settings page.

3. The [Viva Goals](https://ally.io/) settings page will contain a set of instructions that will enable the integration, along with a field to enter the API key. To obtain the [Viva Goals](https://ally.io/) API key, the settings page will have a link which will navigate you to the admin page in JIRA where you can generate and copy the API key.

4. Once the API key is entered/pasted into the API key field, the connection is validated and you can select **Save** to complete the form.
