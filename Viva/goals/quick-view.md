# Quick View in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

The quick view is a panel that appears on the right side of a page when you click on the title of an OKR or a project. This view provides an overview of the progress, details, alignment, children and activity for an OKR or a Project.

It provides all the information pertaining to an OKR or a project that the user would need to access and helps independently navigate into the key results and projects for an objective without losing the context on the page you are on.  

## Available actions

When you open the quick view you'll see it has 5 tabs:

1. Overview

1. Key Results

1. Projects

1. Child Objectives

1. Activity

Let's look at how each of these tabs help you with all the information you require about an OKR.

### Overview

The Overview tabs gives you a quick snapshot of the most important information you'll need. This includes:

1. Progress of the OKR - Progress shows the actual progress you've made on the current objective, the expected progress, and your OKR's progress status. You can make progress updates in two ways: dragging the progress scroll bar to input your updates or by clicking the ‘check-in’ button and entering your progress. 

2. Manage Contributions - By clicking on the ‘Manage contributions’ button, you will be able to control how much contribution each child makes to the progress of the current objective. 

3. Last Check-in Note - This shows you what the most recent check-in was about to add extra context to your Progress chart. If you don't see any check-in notes, it might be a good idea to add one.

4. Owner - Shows the owner of the objective.

5. Type - Shows the type of the current objective's entity. You can change the type from here to either Organization, Team, or Individual.

6. Time period - Displays the time period the current objective belongs to. 

7. Last Updated - Shows when the current objective was last updated.

8. Add a description - Clicking on this allows you to add a quick blurb on what the objective is about to provide others with more context.

9. Alignment - This shows you how the current objective or project is aligned to its parent entity. For example, if you're viewing a objective's quick view, you'll see how it's aligned to a parent objective, if any. If you wish to edit the alignment of one entity with another, click on ‘Edit’ button.

### Key Results

The Key Results section of the quick view shows you all the key results that have been created for the current objective. You'll also see how much progress was made towards this key result, which team owns it, and the owner of the key result. If you haven't created any key results, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

### Projects

Similar to the key results, projects section shows you all the projects that ladder up to the current objective. You'll also see how much progress has been made on the project. If you haven't created any projects, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

### Child Objectives

All objectives can have a child objective aligned to them. You can view and navigate to the child objective from this section. If you haven't created any child objective, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

Alternatively, you can also do all the above by selecting ‘...’ from the list view and clicking on the appropriate options.

If you'd like to view all the information pertaining to an OKR and a project such as the progress, details, alignment, children and activity, you can access them from a full paged detailed view. You can get to the detail view by clicking on the link to "open in full view" from the list/ quick view or from an objective link inside a notification.
