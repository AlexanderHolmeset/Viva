# Views in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## What are views

Views in Viva Goals let you find OKRs & Projects across different entity (Company/Team/My OKR) pages easily. You can use the rich filtering capabilities and grouping controls on how OKRs and projects are grouped and listed. You can also select from a list of preset views, create custom views and share them, or set them as the default view for an entity.

## Default view

The default view across the **Company**, **Team**, and **My OKR** pages will show the list of **all active OKRs** in the current active time period your organization is in. This default view is the one initially set by Viva Goals. You can create a custom view or use any of the preset views as the default view.

## How can I set a view as default?

To set a new view as default:

1. Open the views dropdown and hover over the view of your choice.
1. Click on the “More Options” right next to the view name and click **Set as default view**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/set-as-default-view.gif" alt-text="Setting the default view":::

   Alternatively, if you wish to set a view that you’re seeing as the default option, you can use the “More Options” next to the view title and click **Set as default view**.

## Who can set default views? 


|Pages to set Default View For  |Entity  |
|---------|---------|
|My OKRs and Projects page     |   Every individual can set their own default view for their OKR and project pages.       |
|Team OKRs and Projects page     |  Team owners and administrators are allowed to set default views for Team and Sub-team OKRs and Projects page.       |
|Company OKRs and Projects page     |   Only organizational administrators are allowed to set default views for Company OKRs and Projects page.      |

## View options

Each view has a list of ‘More Options’ that lets users perform a set of actions on the view such as:

- Duplicate
- Rename
- Delete
- Set as Default View
- Get Info 
- Print

## Preset Views

Preset views are readily available views that categorize OKRs and projects based on their status, time period, and so on, and help easily surface OKRs and projects you’re looking for. The list of preset views varies according to the Company/Team/My OKR page. Here’s the list of preset views available across each entity OKR page in Viva Goals.

|Preset OKR views  |Entity (Individual/Team/Company OKR page)  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Active period OKRs     |   My OKRs, Team OKRs, Company OKRs      |     List of all OKRs that are active time periods. “Active time period” is derived based on the time periods that are grouped together as “Active” in the time period picker. For example - Annual + Q2 + H1 can be grouped together and considered as “Active” |
|Upcoming OKRs     |   My OKRs, Team OKRs, Company OKRs      |     List of all OKRs associated with the immediate upcoming time period.     |

## Who can create custom views?

All users can create and share custom views. The custom views created for any entity will be listed on the same entity’s view page.

## Filters

Filters help you customize your OKR and Project views according to your requirements. The list of filters available right now are described in the following table:

|Filter Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Time period     |   Filter by the active, previous or upcoming time periods.      |
|OKR Type     |    Filter by the entity the OKR/project belongs to (individual, team, organization).      |
|Owner     |   Filter by the owner of the OKR/project. You can also refine the list by enabling or disabling the **Include Managers**, **Include Direct Reports** check boxes.       |
|Status     |    Filter by the OKR status.     |

## Group By

The grouping option lets you streamline your OKR and Project views even further. You can group your OKR or project list by the following categories:

- Time period
- Entity
- Owner
- Status

The default group by option is relative to the applied filters or preset views. For example, if you’ve selected the **OKRs needing attention**” view, the OKRs are automatically grouped and listed by **Status**.
