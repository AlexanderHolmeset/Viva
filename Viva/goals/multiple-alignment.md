# Multiple Alignment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

While Objectives and Key Results (OKR) methodology promotes single alignment throughout an organization, Viva Goals recognizes that the modern workplace is often made up of non-linear structures and matrixes. For that reason we created Multiple Alignment.

## What is Multiple Alignment

Viva Goals' Multiple Alignment feature allows users to align a single OKR to two or more above it in the organization.

Multiple Aligned objectives are easy to distinguish from the rest, just look for the double arrow icon.

## Using Multiple Alignment

If multi alignment is enabled you'll be able to align in the same manner as single alignment, you'll just be able to select multiple objectives.

In this image you can see we've aligned to both **Culture Communication** and **Deliver Project Y by first week of December**.

## How Multiple Alignment works?

If an objective is aligned to multiples above, the progress roll-up will cascade up as normal, you're simply contributing to both objectives at a higher level. 

## When to use Multiple Alignment?

- If there's an individual objective that contributes to two separate team objectives, multi-alignment becomes handy.

- You can also use multi-alignment to group similar individual objectives that are separately aligned to teams above, into a single individual objective, further improving the focus of your personal dashboard.

Have you come up with other ways to you use it? Let us know, we'd love to share your story with other Viva Goals users.

## Multiple Alignment vs Private Objectives

Viva Goals now allows enabling both the Multiple Alignment & [Private Objectives](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectiveshttps://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectives) features at the same time for an organization with the following few restrictions:

- A Multi-Aligned Public OKR can be made Private, but all of the alignment will first be automatically removed before it's made Private.

- No Key Result of a Private Objective will be allowed to be Multi-aligned.
