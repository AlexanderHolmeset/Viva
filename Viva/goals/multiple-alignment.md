# Multiple Alignment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. Viva Goals is only being released to WW tenants. It isn't being released to GCC, GCC High, or DoD environments. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals recognizes that the modern workplace is often made up of non-linear organizational structures and goal matrixes. The Multiple Alignment feature helps with this. 

## What is Multiple Alignment? 

The Multiple Alignment feature in Viva Goals allows users to align a single OKR to two or more above it in the organization.

Multiple Aligned objectives are easy to distinguish from the rest, just look for the double arrow icon.

## How to use Multiple Alignment

If Multiple Alignment is enabled, you'll be able to align in the same manner as single alignment, but you'll be able to select multiple objectives.

In this image, you can see the alignment to both **Culture Communication** and **Deliver Project Y by first week of December**.

If an objective is aligned to multiples above, the progress roll-up will cascade normallyâ€”you're simply contributing to both objectives at a higher level. 

## When to use Multiple Alignment

- If there's an individual objective that contributes to two separate team objectives

- To group similar individual objectives that are separately aligned to teams above into a single individual objective, further improving the focus of your personal dashboard

## Multiple Alignment and Private Objectives

Viva Goals now allows enabling both the Multiple Alignment and [Private Objectives](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectiveshttps://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectives) features at the same time, with the following restrictions:

- A Multiple Alignment Public OKR can be made Private, but all of the alignment will first be automatically removed beforehand

- No Key Result of a Private Objective will be allowed to use Multiple Alignment
