# Private Objectives & Key Results

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

While Objectives and Key Results (OKR) methodology promotes transparency across the entire organization, Viva Goals recognizes that large enterprises often have sensitive objectives that require a limited audience.

## What are Private Objectives?

Viva Goals' Private Objectives feature allows user to set private objectives visible only to themselves and designated individuals.

Private objectives are easy to distinguish from the rest, just look for the **padlock icon**. Hovering over the icon will display the list of users that can see this objective and allow the owner to manage this list.

Private objectives will only be visible to this list of users and to the rest of the organization, it will appear as if they don't exist.

Private objectives will be visible in the Objective Explorer to users with the given permission.

Private objective's comments, likes, check-ins, etc. will only be visible to the designated list of viewers.

Private objectives can be set at the Organization, Team, or Individual levels.

## Make an Objective Private

If your organization has this feature enabled, visibility can be managed while creating or editing objectives.

By default, all objectives will be visible to the entire organization unless configured with the following steps:

1. Select **Who can view** on the **Add/Edit Objective** window.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/viva-goals-private-objectives-2.png" alt-text="Private Objectives 2":::

2. Select **Choose who has access** to make it private to only this list of people and select **Done**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This list of users will also be able to see any key results below the objective.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/viva-goals-private-objectives-3.png" alt-text="Private Objectives 3":::

3. Now the user can see this objective is private to them and one other person.

    The privacy of an objective can be edited or changed at any time by the owner of the objective.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Making an objective **Private** will automatically cascade the same privacy settings to its Key Results.
> - An Objective cannot be made Private, if any of its Key Results are Multi-Aligned.  
> - The Key Results of a Private Objective cannot be multi-aligned to more than one Private Objective.
> - Private OKRs cannot be aligned up to Public OKRs by default.
> - In case, your organization is looking for the ability to have Public Objectives with Private Key Results, i.e. Private KRs aligned to Public Objectives, specify when requesting for the Private OKRs feature, so we can enable it.
>
> Example: If you prefer keeping an objective **Double Quarterly Revenue in Q1-2021** as public but have two or three KRs with the actual Revenue numbers as Private (viewable only by the leadership/sales team) until a point before publishing it org-wide, we now have built the additional capability to support this. In this case, only the users added to the privacy setting of the KRs can see the KR and the actual values of progress on it. The Public objective will only indicate the % progress and other users will not have visibility to the private KR progress.

If you have an enterprise subscription and would like to have the Private OKRs feature enabled for your organization, have an account admin reach out to your CSM or [support@ally.io](mailto:support@ally.io) with the request.
