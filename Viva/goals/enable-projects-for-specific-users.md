# Enable Projects for specific users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Projects in Viva Goals help you author better Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) by separating your outputs from your outcomes. For more information, see [What are Projects?](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4224975-what-are-projects)

Until you find your feet with Projects, this feature can be enabled for specific users in your organization, instead of the entire organization. This will let you try out the feature with a few users, before turning it on for the entire organization.  

## Scope for enabled users

1. The **Projects** tab will be visible only for enabled users on all user, team and organization OKR pages.

2. Enabled users can **create, edit, and update** Projects.

3. Enabled users can **clone** Projects.

On the other hand, users who donâ€™t have Projects enabled won't see a **Projects** tab anywhere in the system. They can't create new projects or clone existing ones anywhere in the system. However, they could still view projects aligned under OKRs on user, team and organization OKR pages they have access to. If they have edit permissions for OKRs on those pages, they'll have the same on projects. The feature is designed to prevent new project creation for non-enabled users.

As an individual user, if you want this feature enabled for you, reach out to your OKR champion or, feel free to drop a line directly through our chat channel. We'll enable this for you, so you can hit the ground running.
