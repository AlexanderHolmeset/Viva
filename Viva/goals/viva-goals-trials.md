# Try Viva Goals

## Viva Goals self-serve trial

Individuals can sign up for self-service trials of Viva Goals on their organization’s existing Microsoft 365 tenants with their business logins. They can try out the full functionality of the product for 60 days before requesting their IT Admins to purchase paid licenses for their business groups. If users or teams run into any issues signing up for trial licenses, then it is recommended that they contact their IT department.

Self-service trials are available worldwide. They are not available for Government customers. 

Individuals can sign up for the trial from the [Goals product page](http://goals.microsoft.com/). No payment information is required to start the trial. Information about the trial expiration will appear on the Goals web page.
