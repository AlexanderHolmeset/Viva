## About the Planview Projectplace integration 

The Viva Goals Planview Projectplace integration allows you to link OKRs to your project boards for automatic real-time updates. 

Let's take this example: you have an objective to create an amazing user experience. You can directly link this objective with the project you are running in Planview, so whenever you make an update and move a card in your project board, your OKR status gets updated automatically. 


## How to set up a Planview Projectplace integration

### Create a connection

1. Navigate to your sidebar and select on **Admin > Integrations**.

### Edit an existing connection

You can edit an existing connection’s name and the connection’s shared state that you’ve created from the Projectplace integration’s view. 

Select the **Edit** icon right next to the connection.  In the pop-up that follows, you can make changes to the connection name and enable or disable the **Share connection with all users** checkbox. 

## How to use the Planview Projectplace integration 

Once your integration is set up, you can measure your OKRs progress by connecting your new or existing OKRs with a board in Planview Projectplace. 

1. While adding or editing an Objective or Key Result, you should choose to measure progress by **Percent Completed**. 

2. Select **Planview Projectplace** from the list of integrations available. If there are multiple connections listed, choose a connection you’d like to use.

5. The OKR syncs automatically every hour, but you can refresh it manually by selecting **Sync Now**.
