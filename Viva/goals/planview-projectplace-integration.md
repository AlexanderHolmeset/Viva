# Planview Projectplace integration

## About the Planview Projectplace integration 

Viva Goals’ Planview Projectplace integration allows you to link OKRs to your project boards for automatic real-time updates. Say, for instance, you have an objective to create an amazing user experience, you can directly link this objective with the project you’re running in Planview, so whenever you make an update and move a card in your project board, your OKR’s status gets updated automatically. 


## Setting up 

### Creating a connection

1. Navigate to your sidebar and select on **Admin > Integrations**.

2. In the integrations section,  navigate to the **Planview Projectplace** and select **Manage**.

3. Select **New Connection** and in the popup that follows, sign in to your Planview Projectplace account to authenticate the connection. 

4. Name your connection and select **Next** to complete the setup. 


### Editing an existing connection

You can edit an existing connection’s name and the connection’s shared state that you’ve created from the Projectplace integration’s view. 

Select the **Edit** icon right next to the connection.  In the pop-up that follows, you can make changes to the connection name and enable or disable the **Share connection with all users** checkbox. 

### Using the Planview Projectplace integration 

Once your integration is set up, you can measure your OKRs progress by connecting your new or existing OKRs with a board in Planview Projectplace. 

1. While adding or editing an Objective or Key Result, you should choose to measure progress by **Percent Completed**. 

2. Select **Planview Projectplace** from the list of integrations available. If there are multiple connections listed, choose a connection you’d like to use.

3. Next, map the OKR to the project, board, assignee, due date, and activity of your choice. 

4. Select **Next** to finish and save your OKR. You’ll now see a Planview Projectplace icon next to the OKR ‘s progress indicator, which means Viva Goals will automatically measure the progress based on the number of cards moved to the **Done** list. (‘Completed’ state)

5. The OKR syncs automatically every hour, but you can refresh it manually by selecting **Sync Now**. 

    Say, for example, you have an objective to 'Create an amazing user experience with the revamped product tour'. You can create a corresponding project place board where you've listed out all the action items for the product tour revamp. As you start pushing each action item to the **Done** state, your objective's overall progress gets updated automatically. 

### Disabling the integration

The integration may also be disabled at any time from the 'Change' dropdown in the Projectplace integration view.
