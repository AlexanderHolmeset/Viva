# Customize Review Dashboard

After landing on the Review Dashboard page, the first step is to select the review period. Depending on your review cadence, select a period. Here’s what the review period signifies — the large bar shows the progress of the objective as on the end date of the review period, and this is compared to where it was on the start date of the review period that is indicated by the small bar.

To gain expertise on what a Review Dashboard comprises, see [components of a Review Dashboard](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4362733-components-of-a-review-dashboard).

## Add panels to the dashboard

- The default panel comprises of the objective list widget. Towards the tail end of the dashboard, you’ll have a provision to **add more panels** to the dashboard.

- As you create a panel, provide a name for the panel. For greater flexibility over building the dashboard to cater to your requirement, you can move a panel up or down.

- Towards the right-end of the panel, select the More Actions icon to edit, or delete the panel.

## Add widgets to a panel

- Create a new panel, and start adding widgets to the panel from the list of widgets available.

- Alternately, to add widgets to an existing panel, select the three-dot icon towards the right-end of a panel and select **Add a widget** from the dropdown options.

- Once you’ve added the widget to the panel, you can select the cog icon towards the right-end of the widget to edit the widget. In order to delete a widget, you'll have to edit a panel, and select the delete icon, adjacent to the cog icon.

- When you edit the entire panel, each widget of the panel can be resized, and moved up or down based on your requirement. Also, to expand each widget select the expand icon (next to the cog icon) for better readability.

## How can I present the dashboard?

On the **top-right corner** of the dashboard, you'll find the **Present** button. Review Dashboard is a presentation-ready dashboard wherein each panel becomes a standalone slide of the presentation. This helps you in presenting real-time data on the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) progress, without juggling tools during a review meeting, which eliminates the need to export data outside Viva Goals.

## FAQs

### Who can update the Key Updates on review dashboards?

Dashboards can be created and shared across every level of the organization. Let's take a look at better collaboration opportunities available with the review dashboards.

The key updates section in the review dashboards can be edited by people other than the owner, depending on the OKRs that have been selected.

**For Objective List widget key updates,** all users who own the OKRs included in the objective list or any user who has edit access to the dashboard can modify or add a new key update.  
**For Objective detailed widget key updates,** the key updates go in as a new check-in to the objective so the permission levels also reflect accordingly. Since any user can't make edits to another user’s check-ins, therefore, the key updates for the objective detail widget on a dashboard can only be added by other OKR owners, and not edited or removed at this point.  

To learn more about how to share edit access of your dashboards with other users, see [Share Dashboards](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5148623-share-dashboards).
