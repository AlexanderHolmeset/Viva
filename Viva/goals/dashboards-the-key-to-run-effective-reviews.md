## Dashboards for every review rhythm

Reviews happen across every level of the organization, and oftentimes, you find yourself spearheading, presenting, or participating in different review meetings. For instance, Quarterly Business Reviews, Monthly Departmental Deep Dives, Monthly Town Hall, Weekly Team Meeting, and likewise. It becomes cumbersome to populate data for each of these reviews, and create presentations from the ground up.

Instead of building a dashboard from scratch, you can use Review Dashboard to create a presentation-ready dashboard in no time, and present real-time data on Objectives and Key Results (OKR) progress during review meetings. With the ability to create multiple dashboards, you can save yourself from the hassle of creating or editing presentations for each review meeting, and can streamline all your review rhythms by using dashboards as the single source of truth to present live data on OKR progress at all times.

So, if you are someone who spends a significant amount of time creating presentations before every review meeting, or keeps switching back and forth during a meeting to present real-time data, Review Dashboard will alleviate the challenges in running multiple OKR review meetings.

## Setting up the dashboards

Review Dashboard is available for the company, teams, and individuals. To know more about the basics of a Review Dashboard, read our help article on [Introduction to Review Dashboards](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4362674-introduction-to-review-dashboard).

- Navigate to the OKR page of the company, team, or individual, and select the **Dashboards** tab.

- You will find a drop down with the name 'Dashboard'. Select the drop down to find a button to create a **New Dashboard**. You will be provided with the options to create multiple widgets for this dashboard.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you've already created a dashboard for this entity, you will find that here. If not, you will find the default widgets of the dashboard that you can build on.

- Start adding panels and widgets to the dashboard.

- To edit the dashboard, select the three-dot icon towards the right-end corner (adjacent to the Present button). You can make the following edits to the dashboard â€“ rename the dashboard, clone the dashboard, and set a default dashboard.

- You can clone a dashboard, and by cloning, you will be able to copy the content and template for you to get started with dashboards in no time. You can clone dashboards from one entity to the other, or within the same entity as well.  

    For example, Amelia and Maynard are members of the Marketing team. Maynard can clone Amelia's dashboard (cloning within the same entity) to follow the same review template. On the other hand, Amos from the Customer Success team can clone Amelia's dashboard to copy the contents of commonality between the two teams (cloning into a different entity).




For detailed steps on how to set up a dashboard, read the help article on the [know-hows of a Review Dashboard](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4362767-know-hows-of-review-dashboard). You can now get started with creating separate dashboards for each review meeting.
