## Introduction to Cloning Projects

Cloning projects is a quicker way of creating new projects while retaining the existing settings, and tasks pertaining to the cloned project. In addition, towards the end of a stipulated time period (for instance, end of a quarter), you might not have been able to make desired progress on a few projects, and might not have been able to get started on a few of them. You can carry unfinished projects in Viva Goals to the subsequent time period by simply cloning them. This is an efficacious method to roll over unfinished projects than editing the time period.

In this article, we'll show you when to clone projects, and how to do it.

### When to clone Projects?

Here’s when cloning might come in handy:

1. A quicker way to set new Projects for the current time period

2. An easier way to carry over unfinished Projects to a new time period

Say, you’ve spent the better part of your planning phase carefully creating Projects, delegating ownership, and adding due dates, that aligns with the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Within a team, most of them will have similar Projects based on the functionality — for instance, the Product Marketing Team will have projects that are similar, but support different features because the rollout plan for a feature release will remain the same. Instead of creating Projects all over again, you can clone the projects, make some quick edits, and hit the ground running. The ability to clone projects makes it simple to get set up quickly, while still allowing the flexibility for personalization.

While you’re scoring and closing OKRs, you stumble upon unfinished projects, which you would like to continue working on, and so you decide to roll them over to the subsequent time period — for instance, you have an objective to increase brand awareness by publishing 10 blogs. Owing to various reasons, you’re unable to publish 10, and end up getting five blogs out the door. You can clone this project to the next quarter, and continue to work on the remaining five blogs to accomplish your target. By cloning a project, you’re saving the progress in your current time period, and resetting the progress for the next time period. This is way more effective than editing the time period of projects.

### How to clone Projects?

1. Against a specific project, select **More actions** icon, and select **Clone**.

2. From the dialogue box, configure the following:  

    **Time period:** Viva Goals will default to the current time period (useful if you’re duplicating projects). If you're carrying over unfinished projects, select the appropriate time period from the dropdown menu.

    **Owner:** Choose to either retain the original owner, or assign a new one.

    **Entity type:** The Project can be assigned to an organization, a particular team, or a specific user.

    **Alignment:** By default, the cloned project will be unaligned. Select **Add alignment**, if you want the project to align with an objective.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unaligned OKRs will be displayed only in the Projects dashboard, and not in the current time period view. Unless you align the project to an objective, you will not be able to see the Project in the current time period view.
