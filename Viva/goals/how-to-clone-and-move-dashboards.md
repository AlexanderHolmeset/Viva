As a team owner or team admin, often a need arises to clone a dashboard to retain the same structure across the entire organisation. One can achieve this in Viva Goals by making use of the **Clone**, **Clone and Move** and **Set as Default** functionalities on Dashboards which aid users in performing the cloning operations.

## How to Clone a dashboard

**Step 1:** Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab in the **My OKRs** window.

**Step 4:** By default, the name of the cloned dashboard will be "**Copy of \<dashboard name\>**". You can edit the name to easily identify the cloned dashboard, edit widgets and then select **Save**. After cloning, the user will land on the cloned dashboard.

## How to Clone and Move a dashboard

**Step 1:** Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab in the **My OKRs** window.

**Step 4:** From the popup, select the **Type** drop-down menu to select the entity where the dashboards need to be cloned.

- *Type*: **Individual**

  - By default, Viva Goals will set your name in the **Select User** drop-down menu. Once selected, click on Save. This action will clone the dashboard for your user.

## How to use Set as Default?

The **Set as Default** allows the user to save the dashboard they want to view as the default dashboard for themselves.

## Frequently Asked Questions
