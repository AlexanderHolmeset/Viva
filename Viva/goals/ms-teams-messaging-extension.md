# Share OKR updates in Microsoft Teams chats

You can surface specific OKRs and Projects within your Teams chats to add more context to your conversations. You can discuss progress, proactively identify and resolve blockers, and use Viva Goals to focus on the work that needs your attention. With the Microsoft Teams messaging extension, you can also make updates to your OKRs without leaving your chat.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have a Viva Goals account.

Follow these steps to insert an OKR/project in your textbox:

1. Log in to your Teams app.
2. Open up the chat where you would like to pull up your OKR progress.
3. Select the ellipse **...** button below your text box.

4. In the search box, type Viva Goals. The messaging extension for your organization’s Viva Goals account will appear.
