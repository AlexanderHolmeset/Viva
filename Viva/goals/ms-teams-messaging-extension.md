## How to make updates to your OKRs via the Microsoft Teams messaging extension

To update your OKRs on the fly via Microsoft Teams Messaging Extension, follow these simple steps:

1. Click on **View Details** on the OKR/project card that has been shared in the chat. A pop-up with all the details of the OKR/Project will appear.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/view-details-option.png" alt-text="The View Details button on the OKR/project card":::

1. **A**: If the card selected is an objective/key result, you will be shown 4 tabs - **Overview**, **Key Results**, **Projects**, and **Activity**. The overview tab shows the details of the objective/kr such as the title, progress bar, owner, type, time period, last update’s date, tag, description, and alignment. The **Key Results** and the **Projects** tabs display the list of key results and projects that are aligned to the objective/key result, respectively. The activity tab lets you view the recent activity.

### FAQs

1. **Q**: If I don't have the permission to view a team's OKRs/Projects in Viva Goals, would I be able to view them on MS Teams when they’re shared with me via the messaging extension?

   **A**: No, you would need to be a member/owner of that team in Viva Goals to view the OKRs/Projects that are shared with you on MS Teams.

2. **Q**: What does this error message 'Return to the main window to perform this action' mean and why does it appear?
