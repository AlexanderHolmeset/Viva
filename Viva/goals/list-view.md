# List View in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

The list view is the default view in your OKRs page that shows you all your OKRs and projects and related information such as the title, type, owner, time period, and progress.  This view enables you to not only create and browse OKRs for a team or user but also review and run OKR deep dives for a specific team.

When you wish to look at all your OKRs and projects for a particular time period in one place, see how you’ve progressed, and run deeper reviews/retrospectives; the list view is your best friend.  

Here, all the OKRs and projects are listed in a hierarchical structure with a dropdown next to them to expand or collapse the OKRs. When you click on the dropdown to expand an objective, you will be able to view all the key results, child objectives, and projects under that objective.

You can also view the parent objective that a particular objective is aligned to.

## Understanding the hierarchical structure in the List view 

There are three levels of hierarchy in an organization: 

- Organization OKRs & projects 

- Team-level OKRs & projects 

- Individual OKRs & projects  

The typical hierarchical structure in Viva Goals is as follows:

Objective/Parent objective 

-> Key result 

->Project 

-> Child Objective 

	-> Key result 

	-> Project 
  
## Various options available in the List view 

1. Time periods - The time period picker helps you select the time period whose OKRs and projects you want to view.

2. Summary panel - View the progress and status of all your OKRs in that time period, along with the expected vs actual progress comparison.

3. KPIs panel - You can view the KPIs that are used to track your OKRs in this section. 

4. Add objective - Create an objective of the type of organization/team/individual.

5. Drag and drop - Rearrange the OKRs and projects according to your needs using this option.

6. Multi-select - Select multiple OKRs using checkboxes from the left side of the specific OKR.

7. View options - From this drop-down, you can select to show more info, expand all OKRs by default, show OKRs in a flat view, and compare to a time period.

8. Bulk Check-in - Make check-ins to multiple OKRs at once that in need check-in updates.
