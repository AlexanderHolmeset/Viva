# List View in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

The list view is the default view in Viva goals that enables creating, reviewing and tracking progress for a list of OKRs and projects of an organization, team or user across one or more time periods with all the related information such as title, type, owner, time period, status, progress and alignment.

The OKRs and projects in this view are listed in a hierarchical tree structure with the ability to expand or collapse them. When you expand an objective, you'll be able to view all the key results, child objectives, and projects under that objective and child objectives and key results in certain cases can be further expanded to see the OKRs and projects that are cascaded under them.

You can also view the parent objective that a particular objective is aligned to.

## Understanding the hierarchical structure in the List view 

There are three levels of hierarchy in an organization: 

- Organization OKRs & projects 

- Team-level OKRs & projects 

- Individual OKRs & projects  

The typical hierarchical structure in Viva Goals is as follows:

`Image for Katie

Objective/Parent objective 

-> Key result 

-> Project 

-> Child Objective 

   -> Key result 

   -> Project`
  
## Available actions

1. Time periods - Time periods are the OKR operating periods or cycles. Every OKR or Project is always tagged to a particular time period and has a start & end date. Time periods are key to help you navigate and find OKRs & Projects for an organization, team or a user.

2. Summary panel - View the progress and status of all your OKRs in that time period, along with the expected vs actual progress comparison.

3. [KPIs panel](#link-to-KPI-Summary-Article] - You can view the KPIs that are used to track your OKRs in this section. 

4. Add objective - Create an objective of the type of organization/team/individual.

5. Drag and drop - To re-prioritise and change the order of OKRs and projects in the list view.

6. Multi-select - Use the checkbox on the list view row to select more than one OKR or a Project to perform bulk edit, move and clone actions.

7. View options - From this drop-down, you can select to show more info, expand all OKRs by default, show OKRs in a flat view, and compare to a time period. The expand view is a time saving view option under the list view which when enabled expands all the top-level objectives listed in the OKRs page, at once, to display one level of children. The flat-list view, another view option under the list view, removes the hierarchical structure found in the default view in the OKRs page and displays them all as a flat list. That is, in this view, the parent and child OKRs are all on the same level and are listed one after another without any nesting. 

8. Bulk Check-in - Make check-ins on multiple OKRs that were not updated since the last check-in reminder in a guided workflow.

9. Group By - The grouping option lets you streamline your OKR and Project view even further. You can group your OKR or Project list by the following categories:

   a. Time period

   b. Entity

   c. Owner

   d. Status

## OKR or project actions

1. Click on the ‘>’ expand icon next to  an objective to view all the key results, child objectives, and projects under it.
