# Check-ins and progress status

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## Check-ins

Check-ins are updates that team members make to the Objectives and Key Results they're responsible for at a regular cadence. Regular check-ins prompt a constant, rhythmic review of OKRs. This helps your team stay on track, course-correct, make necessary changes to outdated or unachievable Objectives, and most importantly, ensure they're spending time on the tasks that really matter.

The fact that all check-ins are visible to everyone in the organization maintains transparency and accountability in the OKR process.

To make a quick check-in, you can go to the list of Objectives and move the cursor over the Objective or Key Result you want to update. Select the check-in option.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-quick-check-in-option.png" alt-text="Image of quick check-in option":::

In the Check-in sidebar:

1. **Tell your team what’s the latest on your OKRs**: This is the place to contextualize your update with a brief note or comment. Be sure to cover any issues or challenges you're facing as well as the progress you've made; numbers don’t always tell the whole story!

2. **Enter progress**: This could be the percentage completion of your task or KPIs met, depending on the metric of success you chose while adding the Objective. 

3. **Flag the overall status**: Is your Objective or KR On Track, Behind, At Risk, or have you Not Started yet? 

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-check-in sidebar.png" alt-text="Image of check-in sidebar":::

Keep it short and crisp; the OKR process doesn't require long-winded explanations on every check-in; you could be spending that time on the tasks that really matter. 

At the same time, remember that anyone in the organization can read your updates, so add enough information for them to clearly and quickly understand the status of your Objective.

After you make a check-in, you’ll notice that the statuses and progress of all parent Objectives get updated automatically. This roll-up reflects and maintains the alignment between different levels of OKRs.

One exception is Objectives tracked by custom KPI, Viva Goals can’t know how the progress of the Key Result will impact the aligned Objectives, and hence Viva Goals won't automatically update the progress. It will have to be updated manually with a check-in. 

## Check-ins for single and multiple owners

If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check-in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set-up a data link on the OKR (to auto-check-in). This user will receive the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, this will prevent all of the owners from receiving reminders, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

**Steps to assign responsibility for check-ins**:

1. Sign in to Viva Goals and select the **+** button on the top panel to create a new OKR.

2. Enter the Objective/ Key Result. To share it with another individual, choose owners from the **Owner option. Here you can assign multiple owners for the OKR.

3. Select the user who will be responsible for making check-ins from the **Who is responsible for making check-ins?** drop-down.
Once you make the selection, the user will  start receiving the check-in reminders.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the owner (the first owner in the case of multiple owners) is set as the person responsible for check-in and users need not explicitly choose unless necessary.

### Likes, Comments, and Mentions

OKRs and ongoing feedback make a great team. Leverage Viva Goals’s social features to foster a culture of ongoing feedback around your OKRs by liking and commenting on your team’s check-ins. To comment on a check-in, go to the **Check-in** on the objective page or find it in the feed. Use ‘**@**’ followed by the name of a team member to mention them in a comment. This sends them an email notification - perfect for drawing attention to critical updates or opportunities.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-likes-comments-mentions.gif" alt-text="Image of Likes, Comments, and Mentions sections"::: 

### Editing and Deleting Check-ins

If you need to change a check-in or remove one made in error, you may find the check-in on the objective page or feed, and select edit or remove to make the necessary changes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-editing-and-deleting-check-ins.png" alt-text="Image of editing and deleting check-ins"::: 

### Reminders

Viva Goals sends reminders as notifications via email. To learn more about check-in notifications and how you can customize them, see [Check-in reminders and notifications.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications) 

## What is a check-in rhythm? 

Regular check-ins are a key part of an effective OKR implementation. OKRs are closely aligned, and therefore will reflect inaccuracies if they aren't updated regularly. That’s why it’s helpful to send gentle reminders to your team to check in on their OKRs. Setting a cadence to remind teams and users to make check-ins be referred to as the check-in rhythm. 

Notifications remind your team to check in regularly. By default, Viva Goals sends a notification to all team members every Monday at 9:00 AM in the user’s time zone, but the notifications can be customized to fit your business needs. 

### Setting a check-in rhythm

In this section you can set:

1. Frequency (every one, two, or three weeks, or monthly)

2. Days on which notifications are sent. 

3. Time at which notifications are sent.

4. Disable notifications for OKRs that have had check-ins in the past X days (select number of days)

5. Admins or managers of a team can control whether the subteams reporting to their team can set their own check-in rhythm or should follow the parent team's cadence. 

    They can decide if the cadence they're setting should be cascaded down to the reporting teams, or is confined just to their team. 

For instance, the Chief of Staff sets a cadence to notify the users belonging to her team every Monday at 9AM PST. She can choose to set the same rhythm across departments in the organization, wherein all the users of Marketing, Product, Sales, Engineering, and Customer Success teams will receive a notification for check-ins every Monday at 9AM PST. 

The Org Admin can control whether the teams reporting to her can set their own check-in rhythm or should follow the parent team's cadence. The aforementioned situation is a classic example of the subteams adhering to the parent team's cadence. 

The two options that determine the cadence and cascading of the cadence are: 

1. Allow teams to change their rhythm anytime.

2. When saving, apply this schedule to teams. 

> [!NOTE]
> These options are check boxes that need to be ticked, as you see fit.

Let's consider the following scenarios to better understand the usage of these configurations to set a check-in rhythm. 

1. The department head, say Chief of Staff, is setting a cadence for the People Operations department to receive notifications every month on the first Friday at 9AM PST.  The Chief of Staff wants the subteams reporting into her to continue having a cadence of their own (preferably, a weekly cadence). Therefore, she won't cascade this cadence down to the reporting teams, and will let each team set their own check-in rhythm. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-setting-cadence.png" alt-text="Image for setting cadence":::

2. The Head of Marketing is setting a bi-weekly cadence for the Marketing team to receive notifications on every Monday once every two weeks at 9AM PST. The Head of Marketing wants his reporting teams (say, Product Marketing, Demand Generation, and Customer Marketing) to have their own cadence, but highly recommends starting them with the same cadence as the marketing team. In this case, the cadence will cascade down the teams, however, the teams can change this schedule at any given point in time. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-checkin-bi-weekly cadence.png" alt-text="Image of setting cadence bi-weekly":::

3. The VP of Sales wants her team to have a weekly check-in cadence, and is setting a rhythm to receive notifications every Wednesday at 9AM PST. She wants all the subteams reporting into her to follow the same cadence, and doesn't want them to have a cadence of their own, to ensure everyone is caught upto speed every week, and is on the same page. Therefore, she'll set a cadence, cascade it cadence down to all her reporting teams, and not let them change this rhythm.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-weekly-check-in-cadence.png" alt-text="Images for weekly check-in cadence":::

Team Owners and Team Admins can create a custom cadence for reminders for their departments and teams in **Admin -> Team Settings**. These cadences can differ from the organization-level cadence. 

If teams have to follow the parent team's check-in rhythm, the team owners and/or team admins won't be able to change the schedule.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-checkin-rhythm-team settings.png" alt-text="Image for check-in rhythm":::

Once the updates have been scheduled, you'll receive the notification in one of the following ways:

- If MS Teams integration is enabled, the notifications will be sent through the platform. 

- If the iOS or Android App has been installed, you'll receive a push notification.

- If no integrations have been set up, Viva Goals will send a reminder as an email. 

## Different ways to make check-ins in Viva Goals

Viva Goals presents different ways to make check-ins and can be broadly categorized into [Manual Check-ins](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5085046-different-ways-to-make-check-ins-in-ally-io#h_5b6500b86f) and [Auto Check-ins.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5085046-different-ways-to-make-check-ins-in-ally-io#h_1611d2c20a)

### Auto Check-ins

You can choose to make check-ins automatically by:

- [Integrating Viva Goals with tools you use at work every day.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5085046-different-ways-to-make-check-ins-in-ally-io#h_bc08789eda)

- [Rolling up the progress of key results.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5085046-different-ways-to-make-check-ins-in-ally-io#h_e046ade70b)

#### Auto check-in with data integrations

You can connect tools you use for your day-to-day work such as Jira, Asana, Trello, Hubspot with Viva Goals OKRs to automate check-ins and updates in real-time. Learn more about all our integrations [here.](https://help.ally.io/en/collections/30526-integrations) 

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-auto-checkin-integration.gif" alt-text="Image of Auto check-in with data integrations":::

**Roll-up of progress of key results**

The roll-up of progress makes it easy to assess the impact a key result has on its objective and other objectives above (that are in the hierarchy of OKRs). The objective’s progress will be the average of the progress of its key results. Learn more about the roll-up of progress [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/1931651-roll-up-of-progress-of-key-results) and how [progress and status are calculated](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3065807-how-are-progress-and-status-calculated). 

> [!NOTE]
> When an objective is tracked by a KPI metric, Viva Goals will not automatically update the progress based on the progress of Key Results.

#### Make check-ins from MS Teams

Viva Goals integrates with MS Teams and keeps you up-to-date on your OKR progress. 

- [Check-ins from MS Teams](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3727801-microsoft-teams-integration): You can easily make check-ins and get a quick view of your OKR progress by pinning your organization, team or individual OKRs as a tab in any channel or chat. 

### Manual Check-ins

Check-ins are updates that team members make to the objectives and key results at a regular cadence. You can use the pin or maps icon to easily make check-ins and update your OKR. 

In case you have a list of updates that you need to make, bulk check-ins give a focused check-in experience displaying the list of all objectives that are due for a check-in. Learn more about how to make check-ins [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2107055-check-ins-and-feedback).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also make a manual check-in by dragging the progress bar of the OKR. 

## Manually override progress and status

While it’s highly recommended to automate the progress updates of your objectives—either through an integrated data source, or via rollup from children, this automated updated needn’t necessarily reflect the actual progress made. You, as the OKR owner might have better context on how you’re progressing on the objective. In such cases, you can manually override the automated progress and status, and set them as you see fit. 

### How to override progress and status manually? 

Watch the video below to learn how to manually override automatic updates.  

1. To the left of the progress bar, you'll find an icon that is indicative of the current progress mode. To know more about what the different progress modes are, [read our help article](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4754259-progress-modes). 

2. Upon clicking this icon, you'll find the option to make a check-in. Here, you'll find the current progress and status of the objective based on the automatic update. Select ‘Edit progress and status’ to make a manual check-in. 

3. Set the progress and status as you see fit. If you want to continue making manual check-ins, and choose to stop the automatic updates for this objective, tick the checkbox that’s right underneath to stop updating via rollup from children or an integrated source. 

4. If you don't tick this checkbox, you're choosing to stay in the automated progress mode but you'll manually override the progress and status as a one-off instance. The next automatic update will override the manual check-in you're making. 

5. Save your check-in. 

When you manually override the progress and status and choose to stop the automatic updates, the next automatic update will not take effect unless you choose to do so. However, every time you make a check-in, Viva Goals will show you what the automatic values would be. You can decide whether to continue making manual check-ins or revert to the automated mode of updating progress.

### How to resume automatic updates? 

Watch the video below to learn how to exit from the manual override mode and resume automatic updates.

1. Select the manual progress mode icon, and start a check-in.

2. You will be shown the automatic values, and you will see an option to resume the automated updates. 

3. Select **Resume updating automatically from key results** (in case of progress rolled up from children) or ‘Resume updating automatically from an integrated data source’ (in case progress is updated through the integration). 

4. The progress and status will take the automatic values, and the progress mode will be reverted to automated mode.

5. Save your check-in.

## Objective status alerts

Alerts automatically indicate when an objective needs attention or is at risk. Alerts are enabled for all objectives by default. Each user can manage how alerts are displayed for their account.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-manage-alerts.png" alt-text="Image of Managing Alerts"::: 

To Manage alerts, select your Avatar (top right corner), then select **Edit Account Settings** -> **Objective Alerts** and choose your preference. 

### Status indicators

Alerts are displayed in orange or red for each objective. A solid indicator refers to the listed objective, and an outlined indicator refers to a child objective (or even a grand-child objective). 

Select the indicator to see the alert message. 

**Needs Attention**: Shows that an objective (or its child objectives) appear to fall outside of OKR best practices. Indicators include: 

- Not started yet, seven days past the start date.

- Not aligned to any objectives: 
    Objective doesn't have key results and is a team or individual level objective.

- Objective has too many results. Best practice is to have 3-5 key results.

- Score is higher than 0.8. Consider setting the goal higher next time.  

**At Risk**: Shows that an objective (or its child objectives) appear to have a significant issue with configuration or progress. Indicators include: 

- Progress off by more than 25% from expected progress based on start and due date of OKR.

- Objective is past its due date.

- Doesn't have an owner.

- Key Result and Objective time periods don't align.

- Objective dates don't align with period dates.

### FAQs:

1. Why does the check-in required alerts/reminders include the updated OKRs as well?

A: The updates needed warning or reminder emails depend upon the Notification preferences configured in your Viva Goals instance. There's a setting under **Admin > Notifications > Check-in Rhythm > Change Schedule > Do not include OKRs and Projects updated within the last x days**.

When this isn't enabled, Viva Goals will send check-in reminders and display in-app alerts asking to make a check-in irrespective of the last check-in that was made.

Example: If an OKR's progress was updated two days ago and when this setting isn't enabled, you'll receive alerts asking you to update these OKRs. If you configure this and set **Do not include OKRs and Projects updated within the last 5 days**, the OKR updated 2 days ago will be excluded from the reminders/alerts.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-check-in-alerts-reminders.gif" alt-text="Image of check-in required alerts and reminders":::

After modifying these settings, select **When saving, apply this schedule to teams** setting if you want the same to change for all the team's objectives check-in reminders.

You can read more about check-in reminders [here.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications).

2. Who is responsible for check-ins?

A: If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check-in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set-up a data link on the OKR (to auto-check-in). This user will  receive the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, this will prevent all of the owners from receiving reminders, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

3. Can I edit or delete a check-in?

A: If you need to change a check-in or remove one made in error, you may find the check-in on the objective page or feed, and select edit or remove to make the necessary changes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-edit-or-delete-a-check-in.png" alt-text="Image of edit or delete a check-in":::

4. Can I send reminders to do check-ins?

A: Viva Goals sends a notification to all team members reminding them to check-in every Monday at 9:00 AM in the user’s time zone. If the user’s time zone is unknown, the default is PST. 

If you would like to customize the frequency or timing of these notifications, you can do so from **Admin -> Notifications**. To learn more about customizing notifications, see [Check-in reminders and notifications](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications). 

5. Why can't I see certain OKRs in my bulk check-in window?

A: The bulk check-in only displays the OKRs that haven't had any check-ins since the last check-in reminder that was sent to the user for the given OKR.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-bulk-check-in-window.png" alt-text="Image of bulk check-in window":::

6. How to set who receives the Nudge for multiple-owned OKRs?

A: If an OKR has multiple owners, the Nudge notification is sent out to the Check-in owner only.
For example, Customer Success VP and Engineering VP co-own this OKR while Engineering VP is set as the Check-in owner.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-nudge-for-multiple-owned-OKRs.png" alt-text="Image of Nudge for multiple-owned OKRs":::

Clicking on Nudge will open the modal where the Engineering VP will be notified as they're the Check-in owner for this OKR.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-nudge-engineering-vp.png" alt-text="Image of Nudge for Engineering VP":::
