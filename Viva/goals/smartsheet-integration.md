# Smartsheet Integration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. Viva Goals is only being released to WW tenants, and that it is not being released to GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals’ Smartsheet integration allows you to link Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to Smartsheet cells for real-time updates of your progress. For example, you have a sales sheet used to track revenue. By implementing a Smartsheet integration, you can save yourself the hassle of repeatedly going back and forth between your sheets and Viva Goals to update your progress. Viva Goals will sync the values for you, thus saving time while keeping your OKRs current.

## Set up

1. Navigate to Viva Goals’ integrations page through **Admin > Integrations**.

2. **Enable** the Smartsheet Integration.

3. Select **New Connection** and in the popup that follows, follow the prompt to sign into Smartsheet.

4. Name your connection and select **Next** to complete setup.

    Viva Goals allows you to connect with multiple Smartsheet accounts. Select **New connection** to add another instance and use names to differentiate them. These names are displayed to members when they link their OKRs to Smartsheet cells.

    > [!NOTE]
    > All connections are publicly available for use by everyone in the organization.

    The integration may also be disabled at any time from the **Change** dropdown.

## How to use the Smartsheet Integration?

Now that the integration is enabled, your team can link a Smartsheet cell with an OKR.

1. While adding or editing an Objective or Key Result, select **track by KPI**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > At this time, you may only track by key performance indicator (KPI), not percentage completed, if you would like to use the Smartsheet integration. Go ahead and add the integration.

2. In the popup box, indicate the cell you would like to link the metric with. Select **view** to preview your sheet. In the following example, we'll locate and use Sales-Region3, row 6.

3. Select **Next** to finish and save your OKR. You should now see an icon next to the OKR. The OKR will sync automatically every hour, but to refresh it manually select **refresh**.

It’s as simple as that! Now you know how to work smarter with Viva Goals and Smartsheet.
