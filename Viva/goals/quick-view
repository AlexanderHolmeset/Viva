The quick view is a pop-up that appears in the OKRs page whenever you click on an OKR/project. Instant updates to your OKRs and projects can be made by taking advantage of the options available in this view. 

This is the most-used view as it contains all the information pertaining to OKRs and projects that the user would need to access, which is almost all the information you would find in the detailed view. Take advantage of this view to instantly create, view, and update OKRs and projects on the fly.
