# Roles and permissions in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## Types of roles

In the context of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), a ‘creator’ is someone who has created an objective. An ‘owner’ is someone to whom the objective was assigned.

For example, if a Sales team member, say Steve, wants to suggest an objective to a marketing team peer, say Martha, Steve could add the objective and assign it to Martha. Martha in this case is the owner of the Objective, and Steve is the creator.

Viva Goals supports the following roles within an organization:

|Role  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Members/Regular Users     |    The members/regular users (the default role for everyone) can set up and manage their individual OKRs, and view all OKRs (of the organization's, and of the other teams' and their colleagues').     |
|Observers     |   Observers, as opposed to regular users, can't create; edit; or own OKRs. However, they can view all entities and OKRs like the regular users.      |
|Managers     |    Managers are members who own their OKRs and their reportees' OKRs.     |
|Team Owners     |    Team owners are members who own their team members' OKRs.     |
|Team Admins     |   Team administrators are members who can manage team members.      |
|Organization Admins     |   Organizational administrators are members who manage the setup of the organization and can manage users and teams. An organization can have more than one organization administrator.      |
|Organization Owner  |    Organizational owners are usually the persons who head the organization. They can manage members, teams, set up, and billing for the account. By default, they own the organization-level OKRs, but organizational objectives can be owned by other members also.     |

The member/regular users are entitled to the following types of permissions:

- [Permission levels on individual OKRs](#permission-levels-on-individual-okrs)
- [Permission levels on team OKRs](#permission-levels-on-team-okrs)

### Permission levels on individual OKRs

The permission levels on individual OKRs are described in the following table:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/permission-levels-on-individual-okrs.png" alt-text="Permission levels on individual OKRs":::

### Permission levels on team OKRs

The permission levels on team OKRs are described in the following tables:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/permission-levels-on-team-okrs.png" alt-text="Permission levels on team OKRs":::

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/permission-levels-on-team-okrs-2.png" alt-text="Levels of permissions on team OKRs":::

## Permissions for objectives and key results

Organization administrators and the organization owners in Viva Goals have access to all OKR permissions, for example, creating, editing, and deleting any objectives or check-ins.

### Viewing objectives and key results

One of the tenets of a successful OKR strategy is transparency; Viva Goals enables all OKRs to be viewed by all members in the organization.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/okrs-permissions-entities.png" alt-text="Matrix describing entities that can view all OKRs":::

### Creating objectives or key results

By default, all members in the organization can create OKRs for themselves, other members, teams, or the organization. This privilege reduces the friction in setting up OKRs and facilitates bottoms-up and lateral alignment of OKRs.  

For example, a team member can propose a team-level objective just by adding an objective of type **Team** and can assign it to the primary team manager. The manager can accept the suggestion by executing either of the following tasks:
- Doing nothing
- Changing it to an individual's objective
- Deleting it

The information regarding the entities entitled to create objectives or key results is described in the below table:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-objectives-key-results.png" alt-text="Matrix describing the entities that can create an objective or a key result":::

### Managing objectives or key results

The privileges for each role in Viva Goals are detailed in the following table.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/managing-objectives-key-results.png" alt-text="Matrix describing the privileges for each role":::

Creators are by default provided with the ability to edit and delete objectives. These privileges allow them to correct any errors during creation, like an incorrect assignment.

## Check-ins

The permissions related to a check-in and the entities entitled to those permissions are described in the following table:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/check-ins.png" alt-text="Permissions and entities in the case of a check-in":::

While the checking-in process is largely restricted to those entities involved in the objective, Viva Goals encourages cross-team collaboration by letting anyone in the organization engage with check-ins. This extension of the privileges for a check-in to all entities is described in the following table:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/check-ins-entities.png" alt-text="Coverage of a check-in's privileges to all entities":::

## Administrative Privileges

All administrative privileges are restricted to members with an organization administrator or organization owner role, by default.

### User management

The user management activities and the entities to execute those activities are described in the following table:

## Observer account type

Viva Goals supports two kinds of accounts:
- **Regular Users**: Regular users can access all of Viva Goals' functionality, including creating, updating, and owning OKRs. They can take up additional responsibilities in Viva Goals such as an administrator, team administrator, manager, and so on.

- **Observers**: As opposed to regular users, Observers can't create, edit, or own OKRs. However, they can view all entities and OKRs like regular users.

Using Viva Goals with Observer privileges is described in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/using-viva-goals-as-observer.png" alt-text="Using Viva Goals as an Observer":::

### Privileges of an Observer

An Observer is entitled to the following privileges:

- **Seeing all entities' OKRs**: This privilege enables an Observer to be aware of, and aligned to, organization’s, teams’, and users’ priorities, progress, and updates.
- **Following entities**: This privilege enables an Observer to receive updates for any entities and stay updated to latest developments.
- **Liking and commenting**: This privilege enables an Observer to like and comment on OKRs, check-in, and activity feed updates to engage with leadership team.

> [!NOTE]
> Observers can’t be an OKR owner, administrator, or Team owner/administrator. However, they can be team members, managers, and can have a Manager.

### Enabling Observer feature

To enable the Observer feature for your account, contact Microsoft Support.

### Adding users as an Observer

You can set a default account type for new users from **Admin Dashboard > Setting**. If the value is set to **Observer**, users will take up account type as **Observer** when added through file upload/slack or when they join without invitations (if allowed).

The process of adding a user as an Observer is shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/setting-account-type-to-observer.png" alt-text="Setting Account Type for a new user to Observer":::

The users can choose to send invitations to people with Observer privileges.

### Identifying an Observer

If the users have **Observer** tag against their names, they're an Observer. The process of identifying a person with Observer privileges is depicted in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/identifying-an-observer.png" alt-text="Identifying an Observer":::

If you're an administrator, you can also look at user's Account Type from **Admin Dashboard > Users > Account Type column**, as depicted in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/checking-for-observer-setting.png" alt-text="Alternative method of identifying an entity with Observer privileges":::

### Changing account type of users

Administrators can change the Account Type from **Observer** to **Regular** and from **Regular** to **Observer** through **Admin Dashboard > Users Tab > User listing > Three dot Menu**, as shown in image below:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/changing-account-type-from-observer-to-regular-vice-versa.gif" alt-text="Changing account type from Observer to Regular and vice versa":::

## Inviting other users as Observers

An Observer can invite others as Observers if the Invite Policy in **Admin > Settings** is set to **Anyone in the organization**.
