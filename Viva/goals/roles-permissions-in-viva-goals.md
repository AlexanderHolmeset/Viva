# Roles and permissions in Viva Goals

## Role types in Viva Goals

|Role  |Description  |Common Activities  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Viva Goals Administrators      | Viva Goals Administrators are assigned by Global admins or user admins from the Microsoft 365 Admin center or Azure Active Directory. These are users typically from the IT team (IT admins) and manage the policy settings for Viva Goals for the entire company. <br> </br> This role is optional. In the absence of a Viva Goals Admin, the Global admin can manage these Viva Goals policy settings for the company. <br> </br> For more information on assigning roles in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), see [Assign admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?). <br> </br> Related content: [Azure AD roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/azure-ad-roles-in-the-mac?)         |Some of the aspects managed by Viva Goals Admins are:<br> </br> - [Configure who can create organizations](restrict-organization-creation-permissions.md) within Viva Goals.  <br> </br> - [Configure integrations](vg-integrations-administration-overview.md) are available for all Viva Goals organizations in the tenant. <br> </br> - Control the URLs can be embedded in Viva Goals Dashboards.         |
|Organization admins      |  In case you want to understand more about Organizations, refer here: [What is Organization](understand-orgs-and-teams.md). <br> </br> Organizational administrators are members who manage the OKR process rollout for the org. In an organization, they're generally the OKR champions. They configure  OKR process properties (Time periods, etc.) and can add/remove users to the org. They can create teams within an organization. An organization can have more than one organization administrator.        | Some of the aspects managed by Organization Admins are: <br> </br> -  Organization admins can create OKRs for any team   <br> </br> - Organization admins have access to the [admin settings](navigate-admin-dashboard.md) at the org level. They can set up policy on who can add members to the org, who can create teams in the org, who can create new tags, who can export OKRs from their org.  <br> </br> -  Organization admins can also change time period and notification setting options.    |
|Organization owner      | Organization owners are generally the executive leader of a department/business unit/company for which the organization got created. <br> </br> At the time of organization creation in a tenant, the global admin or any user who has permissions to create an organization would become the organization owner of the newly created organization. This ownership can be transferred to another user in that organization in the admin section of the organization. An org can have only one org owner. <br> </br>  Organizational owners manage members, team. By default, they own organization-level OKRs, but organizational objectives can be owned by other members also.       | Some of the aspects managed by Organization Owners are: <br> </br> -  Organization owners can create OKRs for any team.  <br> </br> -  Organization owners have access to the admin settings at the org level. They can set up policy on who can add members to the org, who can create teams in the org, who can create new tags, who can export OKRs from their org.  <br> </br> - Organization owners can also change time period and notification setting options.     |
|Team admins      |Team admins are generally OKR champions at a team level, who manage the set-up of a team that includes addition of members to the team, permission settings, notification settings, etc. A Team can have multiple team admins.           |Some of the aspects managed by Team Admins are: <br> </br> - Team admins can add members to the team.  <br> </br> - Team admins can modify the notification schedule settings of the team. <br> </br> - Team admins can modify the OKR and Initiative [creation permission](configure-okr-create-permissions.md) for their team. <br> </br> - Team admins can create OKRs for their team. By default, they can edit OKRs of their team. <br> </br> - If the team creation policy is set up appropriately at the org level admin console, team admins can create teams.  |
|Team owners      |Teams are functional units within a Viva Goals Organization. <br> </br> Team owners are typically managers of a team. A team owner can be a people manager or a manager who coordinates a cross functional team. A team can have only one team owner.          |Some of the aspects managed by Team Owners are: <br> </br> - Team owners can add members to the team. <br> </br> - Team owners can modify the notification schedule settings of the team. <br> </br> - Team owners can modify the OKR and Initiative creation permission settings for their respective team. <br> </br> - Team owners can edit or make check-in for all OKRs of their team.         |
|Regular Members      |Regular Members (the default role for everyone) are typically users within an organization who want to actively participate in the OKR process. Viva Goals recommends all users to be added as regular users.         |Some of the aspects managed by Regular Members are: <br> </br> - Regular Members can create team level or org level OKRs and initiatives in teams or orgs provided they have creation access to the orgs and teams. <br> </br> - Regular members can edit, align, make a check-in on their respective OKRs or the OKRs that they've created.        |
|Observers     | Observers, as opposed to Regular members, can't create, edit, or own OKRs. They have only read-only access to the entire organization. Viva Goals recommends all users to be added as regular users instead of observers.        | Some of the aspects managed by Observers are: <br> </br> - Observers can't create, edit or align OKRs. <br> </br> - Observers can like comments on an OKR, share summary of an entity page with other users, and comment on OKRs or Initiatives.           |

## Permissions


|Action  |Access  |
|---------|---------|
|Create OKRs or Initiatives      |By default, every regular user would be able to create team-level or organization OKRs or Initiatives in all levels unless there are explicit permissions for an organization or a team. <br> </br> In case, org admins or team admins want to control OKR or initiative [creation access](configure-okr-create-permissions.md) to specific users, they can configure the same within org/team settings. <br> </br> These are the following roles that would always have create OKRs or Initiatives at all levels: <br> </br> **For Organization level OKRs:** <br> </br> 1. Organization Administrators. <br> </br> 2. Organization Owner. <br> </br> **For Team level OKRs:** <br> </br> 1. Organization Administrators <br> </br> 2. Organization Owner <br> </br> 3. Team Administrators <br> </br> 4. Team Owner <br> </br>  Except for observers everyone in an organization can create individual OKRs or Initiatives (OKRs that don't have a team assigned to them).        |
|Check-in      |The following users get default check-in access for OKRs:<br> </br> 1. OKR owner(s)  <br> </br> 2. Creator of the OKR  <br> </br> 3. Team Admin/Team Owner  <br> </br> 4. Org Admin/Org Owner  <br> </br> 5. Manager of the OKR owner  <br> </br> 6. Owner of the parent O/KR (the OKR to which this OKR is aligned with)  <br> </br> In addition to this, OKR owners can grant extra users with [check-in access](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/check-in-with-viva-goals-c0244789-4388-4d2d-9d20-3678900d9b98) by making them check-in owners.         |
|Alignment     |By default, all regular users in an organization can align to any OKR. In addition to this, OKR owners can grant extra users with [alignment access](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/collaborate-43673d1c-0dd7-42ba-97aa-6e712db171d1) using permissions at an OKR level.         |
|Edit     |Users with edit access to an OKR can also perform the following functions on an OKR: <br> </br> 1. Delete  <br> </br> 2. Modify weights and rollups <br> </br> 3. Close <br> </br> 4. Reopen <br> </br> The following users get default edit access for OKRs: <br> </br> 1. OKR owner(s) <br> </br> 2. Creator of the OKR  <br> </br> 3. Team Admin/Team Owner  <br> </br> 4. Org Admin/Org Owner  <br> </br> 5. Manager of the OKR owner:  <br> </br> 6. Owner of the parent O/KR (the OKR with which this OKR is aligned to)  <br> </br> In addition to this, OKR owners can grant extra users with edit access using permissions at an OKR level. <br> </br> **Note:** A delegate is a user who can perform all the functions of a user with edit access except change the owner for an OKR or Initiative.         |
|Clone     |Users can clone OKR into a team in which they have access to create OKRs. In case, the users don't have creation permission access, the OKR is cloned as an individual OKR(OKRs that don't have teams associated).          |
|Comment/Share/Like/Follow      |These actions can be performed by any user who is a part of an organization.          |
