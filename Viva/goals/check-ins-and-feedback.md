# Check-ins and feedback

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## Check-ins

Check-ins are updates that team members make to the Objectives and Key Results they're responsible for at a regular cadence. Regular check-ins prompt a constant, rhythmic review of OKRs. This helps your team stay on track, course-correct, make necessary changes to outdated or unachievable Objectives, and most importantly, ensure they're spending time on the tasks that really matter.

The fact that all check-ins are visible to everyone in the organization maintains transparency and accountability in the OKR process.

To make a quick check-in, you can go to the list of Objectives and move the cursor over the Objective or Key Result you want to update. Select the check-in option.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-quick-check-in-option.png" alt-text="Image of quick check-in option":::

In the Check-in sidebar:

1. **Tell your team what’s the latest on your OKRs**: This is the place to contextualize your update with a brief note or comment. Be sure to cover any issues or challenges you're facing as well as the progress you've made; numbers don’t always tell the whole story!

2. **Enter progress**: This could be the percentage completion of your task or KPIs met, depending on the metric of success you chose while adding the Objective. 

3. **Flag the overall status**: Is your Objective or KR On Track, Behind, At Risk, or have you Not Started yet? 

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-check-in sidebar.png" alt-text="Image of check-in sidebar":::

Keep it short and crisp; the OKR process doesn't require long-winded explanations on every check-in; you could be spending that time on the tasks that really matter. 

At the same time, remember that anyone in the organization can read your updates, so add enough information for them to clearly and quickly understand the status of your Objective.

After you make a check-in, you’ll notice that the statuses and progress of all parent Objectives get updated automatically. This roll-up reflects and maintains the alignment between different levels of OKRs.

One exception is Objectives tracked by custom KPI, Viva Goals can’t know how the progress of the Key Result will impact the aligned Objectives, and hence Viva Goals won't automatically update the progress. It will have to be updated manually with a check-in. 

### Check-ins for single and multiple owners

If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check-in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set-up a data link on the OKR (to auto-check-in). This user will receive the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, this will prevent all of the owners from receiving reminders, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

**Steps to assign responsibility for check-ins**:

1. Sign in to Viva Goals and select the **+** button on the top panel to create a new OKR.

2. Enter the Objective/ Key Result. To share it with another individual, choose owners from the **Owner option. Here you can assign multiple owners for the OKR.

3. Select the user who will be responsible for making check-ins from the **Who is responsible for making check-ins?** drop-down.
Once you make the selection, the user will  start receiving the check-in reminders.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the owner (the first owner in the case of multiple owners) is set as the person responsible for check-in and users need not explicitly choose unless necessary.

## Likes, Comments, and Mentions

OKRs and ongoing feedback make a great team. Leverage Viva Goals’s social features to foster a culture of ongoing feedback around your OKRs by liking and commenting on your team’s check-ins. To comment on a check-in, go to the **Check-in** on the objective page or find it in the feed. Use ‘**@**’ followed by the name of a team member to mention them in a comment. This sends them an email or Slack (if enabled) notification - perfect for drawing attention to critical updates or opportunities.

## Editing and Deleting Check-ins

If you need to change a check-in or remove one made in error, you may find the check-in on the objective page or feed, and select edit or remove to make the necessary changes.

## Reminders

Viva Goals sends reminders as notifications via email and Slack. To learn more about check-in notifications and how you can customize them, see [Check-in reminders and notifications.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications) 

### FAQs:

### Why does the check-in required alerts/reminders include the updated OKRs as well?

The updates needed warning or reminder emails depend upon the Notification preferences configured in your Viva Goals instance. There's a setting under **Admin > Notifications > Check-in Rhythm > Change Schedule > Do not include OKRs and Projects updated within the last x days**.

When this isn't enabled, Viva Goals will send check-in reminders and display in-app alerts asking to make a check-in irrespective of the last check-in that was made.

Example: If an OKR's progress was updated two days ago and when this setting isn't enabled, you'll receive alerts asking you to update these OKRs. If you configure this and set **Do not include OKRs and Projects updated within the last 5 days**, the OKR updated 2 days ago will be excluded from the reminders/alerts.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-check-in-alerts-reminders.gif" alt-text="Image of check-in required alerts and reminders":::

After modifying these settings, select **When saving, apply this schedule to teams** setting if you want the same to change for all the team's objectives check-in reminders.

### Who is responsible for check-ins?
A: If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check-in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set-up a data link on the OKR (to auto-check-in). This user will  receive the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, this will prevent all of the owners from receiving reminders, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

#### Steps to assign responsibility for check-ins:

1. Sign in to Viva Goals and select the **+** button on the top panel to create a new OKR.

2. Once you enter the objective/ Key Result and want to share it with another individual, choose owners from the ‘Owner’ option. Here you can assign multiple owners for the OKR.

3. Once you assign an owner, select the user who will be responsible for making check-ins from the **Who is responsible for making check-ins?** drop-down.

4. Once you make the selection, the user will start receiving the check-in reminders.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the OKR owner (the first owner in the case of multiple owners) is set as the person responsible for check-in and users need not explicitly choose unless necessary.

Once a check-in owner is assigned to an OKR, users can see a visual indicator that shows the check-in owner details under the objective/ key result.

**The difference between a delegate and a check-in owner**

A delegate gets permissions to edit all aspects of an OKR except the ownership, whereas a 'check-in' owner can only check-in manually or set up an auto integration. A delegate works on behalf of the OKR owner on a specific objective while the check-in owner only updates the progress of an objective on behalf of an owner.

### Can I edit or delete a check-in?
If you need to change a check-in or remove one made in error, you may find the check-in on the objective page or feed, and select edit or remove to make the necessary changes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-edit-or-delete-a-check-in.png" alt-text="Image of edit or delete a check-in":::

### Can I send reminders to do check-ins?

Viva Goals sends a notification to all team members reminding them to check-in every Monday at 9:00 AM in the user’s time zone. If the user’s time zone is unknown, the default is PST. If Slack integration is enabled, the notification will be sent through Slack instead of email.

If you would like to customize the frequency or timing of these notifications, you can do so from **Admin -> Notifications**. To learn more about customizing notifications, see [Check-in reminders and notifications](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications). 

### Why can't I see certain OKRs in my bulk check-in window?


The bulk check-in only displays the OKRs that haven't had any check-ins since the last check-in reminder that was sent to the user for the given OKR.
