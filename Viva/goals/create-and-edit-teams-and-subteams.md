Viva Goals supports multiple levels of hierarchy, from department level all the way down to individual teams and functional units. To achieve this setup, you can use the teams and subteams functionality.

This article describes:

- [Teams](#teams)
- [Team owners and administrators](#team-owners-and-administrators)
- [Team owners](#team-owners)
- [Team administrators](#team-administrators)

## Teams

1. Create a team by choosing **All Teams > Create a new team** or alternatively, **Admin > Teams > Add Team**.

2. In the dialog box that follows, perform the following steps:
    1. Enter a team name.
    1. Designate a team owner from the **Team Owner** dropdown list.
    1. If this team is a subteam, division, or department, select a primary team.
    1. Enter a team type and more details, if necessary.

   In this example, we'll set up a sales territory "Central Territory" (from the **Team Name** dropdown list), under the over-arching Sales Department (from the **Parent Team: (Optional)** dropdown list).

To view all subteams, navigate to the **Parent Team** page and select the **Sub-teams** tab. Using subteams, you can easily replicate the structure of your organization and view how each department, division, and team contribute to organization goals.

In our sales example, we can view the status of all our sales territories at a glance and also view how they contribute to the Sales Departmentâ€™s over-arching goals.

## Team owners and administrators

You can promote or remove any team member as a team owner or administrator in the **Admin** menu item of the **Admin Dashboard** page.

## Team owners

From the **Teams** section of the **Admin** menu item, select **Action > Edit** to update the team owner.

## Team administrators

1. From the **Teams** section of the **Admin** menu item, choose **Action > Manage Members**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/team-admin.png" alt-text="Team admin":::

1. Select the **Action** dropdown list to the right of their name and you'll be able to edit their member status.

As a team administrator, you can create a team in Viva Goals. To do this task, perform the following step:

Choose **Admin > Teams > Add Team**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/team-admin-creating-a-team-method-1.png" alt-text="Team administrator creating a team through Method-1":::

Alternatively, create a team by choosing **All Teams > Create a new team**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/team-admin-creating-a-team-method-2.png" alt-text="Team administrator creating a team through Method-2":::

Once the team has been created, any of the team members can add and view Team OKRs.
