# Archive and delete teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

As an Viva goals administrator, we give you support to manage your teams. Sometimes, teams are dissolved or due to an organizational change, they're retired. If so, we give you the following two options in Viva Goals 
- [Deleting a team](#deleting-a-team)
- Archiving a team

## Deleting a team

Deleting a team is an option whose functionality is permanent in nature; once the team has been deleted, it can't be restored. Delete with caution. 

To delete a team, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Admin > Teams tab > Actions**.
1. Select **Delete** corresponding to the team that you want to delete.

Alternately, you can navigate to the team's OKR page, and delete the team from the options on the top-right corner.

> [!NOTE]
> *To delete a team from the team's OKR page, you need to be an organization administrator or the team owner. Team adminsistrators cannot delete a team*.

A team can only be deleted if it has no objectives assigned to it. If you have objectives assigned to the team, a better alternative is to archive the team.

## Archiving a team

Archiving a team is what we recommend you to use for teams that are no longer in service. You can archive a team by navigating to the **Admin > Teams  > Actions > Archive** against a specific team you want to archive.

To delete a team, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Admin > Teams tab > Actions**.
1. Select **Archive** corresponding to the team that you want to archive.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/archiving-a-team.png" alt-text="Archiving a team":::

Alternately, you can navigate to the team's OKR page, and archive the team from the options on the top-right corner.

Once a team has been archived, it will be marked as **Archived** under the **Teams** tab within the Admin console, and won't be visible anywhere else, say under **My Teams** or **All Teams** menu items. Any objectives that were owned by this team will remain in the same state; however, no new objectives will be assigned to this team.

Archiving a team is an option with a functionality that's not permanent in nature; you can restore an archived team.

To restore an archived team, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Admin > Teams tab > Actions**.
1. Select **Unarchive** corresponding to the team you want to restore.
