# Creating OKRs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

This brief tutorial will guide you through creating OKRs in Viva Goals. Remember that planning out your OKRs beforehand is not only a best practice in general, but it's the lifeblood of the OKR process. For more information about the best practices for writing OKRs, click [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2094140-writing-okrs-best-practices-to-keep-in-mind).

## Creating the objective

You can create an objective from:

1. The individual, team, and organization pages.
1. The list page.
1. A Template - "Sample OKRs"

To create an objective, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the individual, team, or organization that the objective is for. Select the **+** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-an-objective.png" alt-text="Creating an objective":::

1. In the dialog box that pops up, specify the following values:

    1. A short, but descriptive name for the objective.
    1. Edit the details in the following table, if necessary:
     
       
       |Item  |Description  |
       |---------|---------|
       |Type     |    Specify the type as individual, team, or organization level corresponding to where the objective fits in the organization.    |
       |Owner     |    The user who owns this objective - A best practice suggests that every OKR have a clear owner even if it's a team or organization objective.     |
       |Time Period     |   The quarter or time period this objective belongs to.      |

    
    
       > [!NOTE]
       > Viva Goals contextually fills in the following details.


   1. **Outcome**: Add the outcome for the objective. The objective is set to go to 100% complete by default. Alternatively, you can choose to measure the outcome with a metric by setting the start, the target, and the unit. Currently, Viva Goals supports two types of units - % and numeric.
   
   1. **Progress**: Progress indicates the different modes that’ll help you measure the outcome. You can measure progress manually, or have progress update automatically. Automatic updates can be via rollup from key results, or from a data source which can be any of Viva Goals' rich [integrations](https://help.ally.io/en/collections/30526-integrations). For more information about the different progress modes, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4754259-progress-modes).
   
   1. **Alignment**: Set the alignment to show why accomplishing this objective matters. Progress from this objective will automatically roll up to its parents.
   
1. Select create when you’re done.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-or-saving-an-objective.png" alt-text="Creating (or saving) an objective":::

   The **Key results** dialog box will look a little different if you've chosen to configure your OKRs by selecting the **Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option. You'll notice that the **Create Objective** view will just have the **Progress** pane. This look is because when you've configured your objectives to be aspirational and key results to be measurable, the progress of the objectives will be updated by roll up from the progress of key results or manually. For more information, see [OKR Model Configuration Rules](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5214200-configure-your-okr-rules-in-ally-io).

## Creating Key Results

Key results contribute to achieving the objective; if all the key results are accomplished, then the objective must be achieved, so choose them accordingly. Find the objective you just made and select **Add Key Result**. This selection will allow you to edit inline.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-a-key-result.png" alt-text="Creating a key result":::

You can also hover over it and select **Add key result** from **More options** which appears to bring up a more detailed dialog box.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/add-key-result-button.png" alt-text="Creating a key result in another method":::

The dialog box that opens up will look familiar. One key difference you will notice is that it’s already aligned with the parent Objective.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/new-key-result-dialog-box.png" alt-text="New key result dialog box":::

> [!NOTE]
> The **New key result** dialog box will look a little different if you have chosen to configure your OKRs by **selecting the Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option. For more information, see [OKR Model Configuration Rules](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5214200-configure-your-okr-rules-in-ally-io).

## Using templates

Viva Goals makes it easy to jumpstart the OKR process by providing templates for common objectives across different verticals in an organization. To create an objective from a template, select **See Sample OKRs** and choose from our extensive library of presets ranging from sales and marketing objectives to people and product Management.
 
:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/see-sample-okrs.png" alt-text="The See sample OKRs option":::

From here, you can tweak the template objectives - or any other objective - to your company’s specifications by using the handy "edit" functions available on the objectives page. You can also hover your cursor over the objective to find the **Edit** option.

Now go forth and let your OKRs multiply - but not by too much, eh?

## Advanced options when creating OKRs

There are several advanced options when creating OKRs. For example, you can expand the **Progress** section and specify how to track the objective’s progress to the goal. You can choose from any of the following options:

- **Measured as a goal towards 100% completion**: Viva Goals will show the progress in terms of percent completed to the goal.

- **Add a metric**: This option gives you more control to set a custom KPI. You'll have to define the name of the metric, the target, and starting point yourself.

Viva Goals also allows you to automatically update the progress of your objectives by integrating with tools like Jira, Smartsheets, or VSTS. For more information about these integrations, see our detailed articles [here](https://help.ally.io/en/collections/30526-integrations).

Many of these options are available under **More Options** in each pane. Some examples under the **Details** section are:


|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Tags and Description     |   Add tags to group similar OKRs together and enter a short description of the objective if necessary. For more information aboout tags, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2620794-tags).      |
|Private objectives and key results     |   Control who can see your OKRs; available with an Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectives-key-results).      |
|Objective Delegation   |   Designate another individual to keep this objective up to date. Available with an Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152131-objective-delegation).      |

### FAQs

**Q: How to change the owner of an OKR?**

  A: The owner of the OKR can be changed from the OKR list view, quick view, or the full view page. Select the **Owner** field to assign the OKR to a new owner.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/changing-owner-of-okr.gif" alt-text="Changing owner of an objective":::


Alternatives

1. If you'd like more than a single person to own an OKR, you can assign [multiple owners](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4601340-shared-okrs-projects-multiple-teams-owners).
1. If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the "check-in responsibility" feature. The "check-in" owner can only check in manually or set up an auto integration.
1. With Viva Goals' **Delegation** option, you can assign another individual to check in on OKRs that are not owned by them. A delegate gets permissions to edit all aspects of an OKR and also work on behalf of the OKR owner on a specific objective. They'd not be able to change ownership though.

**Q**: **Can I enter my OKRs in languages other than English?**
  
  A:   You can enter your goals into Viva Goals in any language that you're comfortable with by simply typing them in your preferred language.

**Q**: **Can I edit or delete an OKR?**

  A:   If you need to change an OKR or remove one made in error, you may find those options in the menu dropdown in the top-right corner of the screen. Select **Edit** or **Delete** to make the necessary changes.

> [!NOTE]
> An objective may not be edited or deleted if it is **Postponed** or **Closed**. In those cases, the objective would need to be reopened in order to edit or delete.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/editing-an-objective.png" alt-text="Editing an objective":::

**Q**: **How do I print my OKRs?**

  A:   On the desired OKR page, expand the **ellipsis** (3 dots) icon and select **Print OKRs**. Viva Goals also gives you the ability to export a .csv file from the Explorer.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/printing-okrs.png" alt-text="Printing OKRs":::

> [!NOTE]
> You won't see the **Print** option when multiple time periods are selected.

**Q**: **How can I copy one or more Objectives?**

  A:   You can save time-making objectives with the **Clone** function.

## To copy or duplicate a single objective

To copy or duplicate a single objective, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over the objective and select **Clone** from the dropdown on the far right. You can also copy from the objective page by selecting **Actions > Clone**. A dialogue box is displayed.
1. Edit the time period, owner, and the option to copy the objective and key results, or simply the objective.

By default, the cloned objective with all its key results will appear in the same time period as the original. 

> [!NOTE]
> The progress will not be copied over.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/cloning.png" alt-text="Cloning an objective":::

## To copy or duplicate multiple objectives

To copy or duplicate multiple objectives, perform the following steps:

1. From your dashboard, select the objectives you wish to copy by selecting the checkboxes to the left of the objectives.

> [!NOTE]
> Only open objectives can be cloned in bulk; objectives that have already been closed must be cloned on an individual basis.

1. Select the **Clone** button in the blue bar that appears above the list of objectives. You can then select the options from the dialogue box.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/clone-button.png" alt-text="Clone button":::

The cloning process takes place on the back end of our software; so it will take a short time for the system to produce a clone. The bigger the number of objectives chosen to clone, the longer it will take. Be patient and don't make multiple attempts to clone the same objective.

**Q: Why am I not able to add an integration connection to my objective?**

  A: When the OKR model configuration for your account is set as **Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable**, there is no option to update your progress "automatically from a data source".

This lack of options is because according to the configuration, the objectives are aspirational goals; hence the progress of an objective must roll up from its key results.

**Q: The integrations can be used to track the % complete progress as well, so why can't the integrations be used with such objectives?**
 
  A: In the given configuration, setting a metric-driven objective is not recommended. The metrics should be under the objective and ideally a balanced set of more than one, while the objective is an inspirational call to action. That's why there is no option to directly integrate with the objective.

**Q: But what about the objectives that don't have any key results or have only projects aligned to them?**

  A: You can override individual items to contribute. However, each objective is recommended to have two-to-three key results that are the actual measures.
