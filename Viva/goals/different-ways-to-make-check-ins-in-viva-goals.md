You can choose to make check-ins automatically by:

- [Integrating Viva Goals with tools you use at work every day.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5085046-different-ways-to-make-check-ins-in-ally-io#h_bc08789eda)

**Roll-up of progress of key results**

The roll-up of progress makes it easy to assess the impact a key result has on its objective and other objectives above (that are in the hierarchy of OKRs). The objectiveâ€™s progress will be the average of the progress of its key results. Learn more about the roll-up of progress [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/1931651-roll-up-of-progress-of-key-results) and how [progress and status are calculated](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3065807-how-are-progress-and-status-calculated). 

> [!NOTE]
> When an objective is tracked by a KPI metric, Viva Goals will not automatically update the progress based on the progress of Key Results.

### Make check-ins from Slack and MS Teams

Viva Goals integrates with messaging apps like Slack and MS Teams and keeps you up-to-date on your OKR progress. 

- [Check-ins from Slack](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2204706-slack-integration): You can view OKRs, add or edit objectives and make check-ins right from Slack. 

- [Check-ins from MS Teams](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3727801-microsoft-teams-integration): You can easily make check-ins and get a quick view of your OKR progress by pinning your organization, team or individual OKRs as a tab in any channel or chat. 

## Manual Check-ins

Check-ins are updates that team members make to the objectives and key results at a regular cadence. You can use the pin or maps icon to easily make check-ins and update your OKR. 

In case you have a list of updates that you need to make, bulk check-ins give a focused check-in experience displaying the list of all objectives that are due for a check-in. Learn more about how to make check-ins [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2107055-check-ins-and-feedback).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also make a manual check-in by dragging the progress bar of the OKR.
