## Managing time periods

Using OKRs effectively to achieve amazing results usually takes a few cycles.

As you embark on defining OKRs for the new quarter, here are few things to remember:

- OKRs are not cut in stone and if circumstances change mid-cycle, it is okay to drop, add or modify them.
- For improved focus, limit objectives at any levels to at most "five". And no objective should have more than five key results.
- While some of the individual and team OKRs will be cascaded from the top-level organizational OKRs, empower your team members to define some of their OKRs based on the organizational priorities. 
- It's okay if not all OKRs are directly aligned to organization or team OKRs - as long as the individual and manager understand how the OKR indirectly aligns to the top-level OKRs, it's okay.

Here are three steps to get defining OKRs for the new period:

|Step  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[For Managers] Draft organization's OKRs for the new cycle     |   Involve key stakeholders to draft the organization-level objectives and key results for the new period. Use the organization's mission, annual objectives and previous period OKRs for context in drafting the the company OKRs for the new period. Publish them and invite teams and individuals to craft their OKRs based on these top-level OKRs. Ensure everyone understands that you are seeking their input through the OKR process before the top-level OKRs are finalized.      |
|Teams and individuals should draft their OKRs     |      Teams and individuals should draft their OKRs based on the top-level, organizational OKRs. In addition to looking at the top-level OKRs, they should look into OKRs of peers to identify any assumptions and dependencies, and resolve them.   |
|Get all OKRs reviewed     |    Alignment is crucial to the OKR process. As long as your work lines up across the organizational network - vertically and horizontally, the company can make huge strides in a quarter. That is why it is essential to review OKRs with the manager. Having another pair of eyes looking at them doubles the chances of alignment across the board. Once reviewed, make adjustments, lock your OKRs and get cracking!     |

It sometimes takes as many as three to four quarters to get into a rhythm. However, organizations across the globe have perfected the process over time and reaped great benefit, and so can you. OKRs are here to stay.

## Creating the objective

This brief tutorial will guide you through creating OKRs in Viva Goals. Remember that planning out your OKRs beforehand is not only a best practice in general, but it's the lifeblood of the OKR process. For more information about the best practices for writing OKRs, click [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2094140-writing-okrs-best-practices-to-keep-in-mind).

You can create an objective from:

1. The individual, team, and organization pages.
1. The list page.
1. A Template - "Sample OKRs"

To create an objective, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the individual, team, or organization that the objective is for. Select the **+** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-an-objective.png" alt-text="Creating an objective":::

1. In the dialog box that pops up, specify the following values:

    1. A short, but descriptive name for the objective.
    1. Edit the details in the following table, if necessary:
     
       
       |Item  |Description  |
       |---------|---------|
       |Type     |    Specify the type as individual, team, or organization level corresponding to where the objective fits in the organization.    |
       |Owner     |    The user who owns this objective - A best practice suggests that every OKR have a clear owner even if it's a team or organization objective.     |
       |Time Period     |   The quarter or time period this objective belongs to.      |

    
    
       > [!NOTE]
       > Viva Goals contextually fills in the following details.


   1. **Outcome**: Add the outcome for the objective. The objective is set to go to 100% complete by default. Alternatively, you can choose to measure the outcome with a metric by setting the start, the target, and the unit. Currently, Viva Goals supports two types of units - % and numeric.
   
   1. **Progress**: Progress indicates the different modes that’ll help you measure the outcome. You can measure progress manually, or have progress update automatically. Automatic updates can be via rollup from key results, or from a data source which can be any of Viva Goals' rich [integrations](https://help.ally.io/en/collections/30526-integrations). For more information about the different progress modes, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4754259-progress-modes).
   
   1. **Alignment**: Set the alignment to show why accomplishing this objective matters. Progress from this objective will automatically roll up to its parents.
   
1. Select create when you’re done.

   > [!NOTE]
   > These can always be edited later - Ensure to check out the advanced options below.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-or-saving-an-objective.png" alt-text="Creating (or saving) an objective":::

   The **Key results** dialog box will look a little different if you've chosen to configure your OKRs by selecting the **Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option. You'll notice that the **Create Objective** view will just have the **Progress** pane. This look is because when you've configured your objectives to be aspirational and key results to be measurable, the progress of the objectives will be updated by roll up from the progress of key results or manually. For more information, see [OKR Model Configuration Rules](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5214200-configure-your-okr-rules-in-ally-io).

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/different-look-to-dialog-box.png" alt-text="Different looking dialog box":::

### Creating Key Results

Key results contribute to achieving the objective; if all the key results are accomplished, then the objective must be achieved, so choose them accordingly. Find the objective you just made and select **Add Key Result**. This selection will allow you to edit inline.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/creating-a-key-result.png" alt-text="Creating a key result":::

You can also hover over it and select **Add key result** from **More options** which appears to bring up a more detailed dialog box.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/add-key-result-button.png" alt-text="Creating a key result in another method":::

The dialog box that opens up will look familiar. One key difference you will notice is that it’s already aligned with the parent Objective.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/new-key-result-dialog-box.png" alt-text="New key result dialog box":::

> [!NOTE]
> The **New key result** dialog box will look a little different if you have chosen to configure your OKRs by **selecting the Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option. For more information, see [OKR Model Configuration Rules](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/5214200-configure-your-okr-rules-in-ally-io).

### Using templates

Viva Goals makes it easy to jumpstart the OKR process by providing templates for common objectives across different verticals in an organization. To create an objective from a template, select **See Sample OKRs** and choose from our extensive library of presets ranging from sales and marketing objectives to people and product Management.
 
:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/see-sample-okrs.png" alt-text="The See sample OKRs option":::

From here, you can tweak the template objectives - or any other objective - to your company’s specifications by using the handy "edit" functions available on the objectives page. You can also hover your cursor over the objective to find the **Edit** option.

Now go forth and let your OKRs multiply - but not by too much, eh?

### Advanced options when creating OKRs

There are several advanced options when creating OKRs. For example, you can expand the **Progress** section and specify how to track the objective’s progress to the goal. You can choose from any of the following options:

- **Measured as a goal towards 100% completion**: Viva Goals will show the progress in terms of percent completed to the goal.

- **Add a metric**: This option gives you more control to set a custom KPI. You'll have to define the name of the metric, the target, and starting point yourself.

Viva Goals also allows you to automatically update the progress of your objectives by integrating with tools like Jira, Smartsheets, or VSTS. For more information about these integrations, see our detailed articles [here](https://help.ally.io/en/collections/30526-integrations).

Many of these options are available under **More Options** in each pane. Some examples under the **Details** section are:

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Tags and Description     |   Add tags to group similar OKRs together and enter a short description of the objective if necessary. For more information aboout tags, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2620794-tags).      |
|Private objectives and key results     |   Control who can see your OKRs; available with an Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152440-private-objectives-key-results).      |
|Objective Delegation   |   Designate another individual to keep this objective up to date. Available with an Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3152131-objective-delegation).      |

## Best practices to keep in mind

The process of goal setting with OKRs is flexible and adjustable along the way. However, a few best practices go a long way in ensuring that teams have a set of unambiguous and focused set of goals to work toward.

1. Start by defining Objectives at the organization level. These are the top strategic goals that require collaboration and link various departments and teams within the organization.
1. Stick to three to five objectives at every level. Too many Objectives distract us from attaining the ones that matter.
1. Objectives must be actionable, yet aspirational. They are stretch goals that should make you feel slightly uncomfortable.
1. Every Objective should have three to five key results. Together, the Key Results must help realize the Objective.
1. Every key result should be measurable.
1. Alignment is a key aspect of the OKR process. For example, Team objectives can be easily aligned to company-level objectives and Key Results of a team’s Objectives may become the Objectives of some of the team members. Similarly, Key Results of the CEO may become Objectives of the VPs of various teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Key results of company-level Objectives will cascade down to act as objectives to the team level only when you've chosen the option **Objectives and key results can be used interchangeably** in the OKR Model Configuration section in your Admin Dashboard.

1. Allow teams and individuals to create about 40% of their OKRs. A healthy mix of top-down and bottom-up OKRs at every level improves employee engagement and encourages innovation.

Remember OKRs aren't a catch-all list at the top levels - they aren't simply an amalgamation of OKRs of the members. Each Objective must be deliberated on before making it to the list.

## Setting annual objectives

### What are Annual Objectives?

Annual objectives are specific, measurable statements of what a business is expected to achieve within an annual period. These objectives are usually one part or phase of the organization’s longer-term goals, for example, the first-year objectives of a three-year growth strategy. This characteristic puts annual objectives in contrast to quarterly objectives which tend to have a narrower focus and shorter-term deliverables, which begs the following question:

Should you set annual or quarterly objectives? The answer to this question is: why not both? 

Many companies following the OKR process find it valuable to set annual objectives as a tactic to keep their broader vision at the forefront while using quarterly objectives to execute the steps toward that vision. In fact, Google started out by setting quarterly OKRs, but today they set both annual and quarterly OKRs for the maximum impact.

### Writing annual objectives

Writing annual objectives should feel a little different from writing quarterly goals. The larger scope lends itself to broad objectives, for example, "Raise market share by 5%". If that objective sounds like a company-level objective, that’s because it is! It's a good practice to set annual objectives at the organization level and use them in combination with quarterly objectives.

Each annual objective should have 3-5 quarterly key results. These quarterly key results should be department- or team-level (depending on the size of the company) objectives, maintaining alignment through the hierarchy.

Team and individual OKRs are best left at a quarterly cadence - but most of them should still be aligned to annual objectives. It's not necessary or recommended that teams and individuals have annual objectives - which can introduce complexity and divide focus, but there are exceptions.

### Implementing Annual OKRs in Viva Goals

Luckily, coming up with your annual objectives is going to be the hardest part. With Viva Goals, implementing them is a snap!

1. First, you'll want to navigate to the appropriate annual time period. By default, Viva Goals features annual time periods of the format **Jan 1-Dec 31 20XX**, but if your company follows a different cadence, you can set up a custom time period from **Admin > Time Periods**.

1. Write your organization-level objectives.

1. Next, write 3-5 key results per objective. Here’s the secret sauce: set the time period of each key result to the relevant quarter. For example, KR1 might belong to Q1 20XX while KRs 2 and 3 belong to Q2 and so on until you have charted the entire progress of key results leading up to the top-level objective. Try to frontload the work - you’ll thank me later! 

1. Proceed as normal by setting up the team and individual-level quarterly OKRs.

1. Get to work! As individuals and managers make check-ins, Viva Goals will automatically calculate the progress toward your annual objectives. Maintain a bird’s-eye view with our attractive dashboards and use views or the objective explorer to drill down and generate reports where necessary. We happen to enjoy using chart view to easily visualize the alignment.

**An example**: In the screenshot below, we have the broad organization-level objective ‘Double revenue to $20M’ in the annual 2021 time period. The KRs are set up as follows:

- Q1 2021:  "Increase ARR to $14M". Notice how this is the most ambitious of the key results.
- Q2 2021: "Increase ARR to $17M".
- Q3 2021: "Increase ARR to 19M".
- Q4 2021: Finally, the last KR, "Increase ARR to $20M", which was the annual objective.

This setup breaks down a lofty goal into manageable, actionable chunks. The successful completion of all four key results distributed over the quarters will result in the completion of the overall annual goal.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/implementing-annual-okrs.png" alt-text="Implementing annual OKRs":::

You’re all set up. With your new annual objectives, you'll never have to choose between the tactical value and focus of quarterly objectives and the strategic value and ambition of annual objectives. Set your sights on your company’s long-term vision and leverage the power of your OKR alignment to get there!

## How to create committed and aspirational OKRs in Viva Goals

OKR (Objective and key result) methodology supports two types of goals which are described in the following table 

|Goal Name |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Committed OKRs     |   These OKRs are the ones that your organization or team has agreed to execute. These OKRs have a clear action plan on how they would be achieved.      |
|Aspirational OKRs     |    These OKRs are more visionary. These OKRs are stretch goals, and teams are not likely to fully achieve them.    |

Within Viva Goals, users can now switch between aspirational and committed OKRs though OKRs created by default remain aspirational. Committed goals have the tag ‘committed’ which differentiates them from aspirational goals.

The best way to determine whether a goal is aspirational is to check how much of the goal has been attainable. If a user attains 100% of the target and thus closes an objective with a score of 1, the goal isn’t ambitious enough and is marked in "orange". An ideal aspirational OKR or a stretch goal should be challenging but attainable, and a score of 0.7-0.9 is recommended.

With respect to a committed goal, 100% completion ensures a score of 1 and the range is marked in "green", indicating that the user has completed the target which they have committed to achieve.

Here is a short video on how you can set up aspirational and committed OKRs within Viva Goals:

## Scoring Customization

We've also introduced an admin setting where the organization administrator can override the default ranges for the color schemes we have provided for the OKRs. Here, the administrator can configure the scoring ranges against which the color schemes will be mapped.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/scoring-customization.gif" alt-text="Scoring customization":::

## To copy or duplicate a single objective

To copy or duplicate a single objective, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over the objective and select **Clone** from the dropdown on the far right. You can also copy from the objective page by selecting **Actions > Clone**. A dialogue box is displayed.
1. Edit the time period, owner, and the option to copy the objective and key results, or simply the objective.

By default, the cloned objective with all its key results will appear in the same time period as the original. 

> [!NOTE]
> The progress will not be copied over.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/cloning.png" alt-text="Cloning an objective":::

## To copy or duplicate multiple objectives

To copy or duplicate multiple objectives, perform the following steps:

1. From your dashboard, select the objectives you wish to copy by selecting the checkboxes to the left of the objectives.

> [!NOTE]
> Only open objectives can be cloned in bulk; objectives that have already been closed must be cloned on an individual basis.

1. Select the **Clone** button in the blue bar that appears above the list of objectives. You can then select the options from the dialogue box.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/clone-button.png" alt-text="Clone button":::

The cloning process takes place on the back end; so it will take a short time for the system to produce a clone. The bigger the number of objectives chosen to clone, the longer it will take. Be patient and don't make multiple attempts to clone the same objective.

### FAQs

1. How to change the owner of an OKR?

A: The owner of the OKR can be changed from the OKR list view, quick view, or the full view page. Select the **Owner** field to assign the OKR to a new owner.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/changing-owner-of-okr.gif" alt-text="Changing owner of an objective":::

Alternatives

a. If you'd like more than a single person to own an OKR, you can assign [multiple owners](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4601340-shared-okrs-projects-multiple-teams-owners).
b. If there's just one owner or multiple owners assigned to an OKR and you would want a user within the organization to check-in and update the progress of the OKR, you can use the "check-in responsibility" feature. The "check-in" owner can only check in manually or set up an auto integration.
c. With Viva Goals' **Delegation** option, you can assign another individual to check in on OKRs that are not owned by them. A delegate gets permissions to edit all aspects of an OKR and also work on behalf of the OKR owner on a specific objective. They'd not be able to change ownership though.

2. Can I enter my OKRs in languages other than English?
  
A: You can enter your goals into Viva Goals in any language that you're comfortable with by simply typing them in your preferred language.

3. Can I edit or delete an OKR?

A: If you need to change an OKR or remove one made in error, you may find those options in the menu dropdown in the top-right corner of the screen. Select **Edit** or **Delete** to make the necessary changes.

> [!NOTE]
> An objective may not be edited or deleted if it is **Postponed** or **Closed**. In those cases, the objective would need to be reopened in order to edit or delete.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/editing-an-objective.png" alt-text="Editing an objective":::

4. How do I print my OKRs?

A: On the desired OKR page, expand the **ellipsis** (3 dots) icon and select **Print OKRs**. Viva Goals also gives you the ability to export a .csv file from the Explorer.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/printing-okrs.png" alt-text="Printing OKRs":::

> [!NOTE]
> You won't see the **Print** option when multiple time periods are selected.

5. How can I copy one or more Objectives?

A: You can save time-making objectives with the **Clone** function.
