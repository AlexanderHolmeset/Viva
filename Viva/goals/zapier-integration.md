## About the Zapier Integration

Viva Goals’ integration with Zapier enables you to connect Viva Goals with all the tools you use every day. Say, for instance, you have an OKR to 'Deliver thought leadership articles', you can directly link this objective with a Trello card where you're tracking your thought leadership content, so with every checklist item update, a check-in is made automatically to the OKR. 

## Setting up

## How to connect a service of your choice with Viva Goals 

1. Select  **Create Zap** and start by selecting an app for the Zap’s trigger. Go on to choose the app’s trigger event. Once you’re done setting up your trigger, select  **Continue** to set up the action.

    After logging in, you'll get sent back to your zap where you now have your Viva Goals account connected! 

4. Choose the OKR to which you want to connect, select the metric’s progress that should be tracked in order to make check-ins, and add additional notes or comments if any.

5. Set up the rest of your Zap and turn it on, once done. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > OKR Check-ins made from some of your Zaps might take at least 3-5 minutes to reflect in your Viva Goals instance.
