# In-line OKR Experience

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Vival Goals provides a seamless spreadsheet-like experience for users looking to perform OKR without having to switch screens.

With our in-line OKR experience, users can:

1. Add and edit objectives

2. Perform check-ins and add updates

3. Add key results and projects

4. Change objective owner

5. Rearrange OKRs with an enhanced drag and drop experience 

The new slider progress bar allows instant check-ins. The autocomplete status automatically calculates based on the selected progress. Check-in notes are now optional, that saves time when performing a check-in in-line.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to use the in-line experience to add key results and projects, if you have configured your OKR model by selecting the **Objectives are always aspirational, key results are always measurable** option. You can still add key results and projects by selecting the **More Actions** button.
