# Introduction to Review Dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]

## What is a Review Dashboard?

Review dashboard is a customizable, presentation-ready dashboard that populates real-time data on Objectives and Key Results (OKR) progress, thereby eliminating the need to create a presentation from the ground up, every time before a review meeting.

You could be using several tools to track metrics that are closely correlated to the OKR progress within Viva Goals. Instead of juggling tools to present real-time data during reviews, Review Dashboard enables you to bring key performance indicator (KPIs), visualizations, projects, trends, and contextual information on OKR status under a single roof. This will foster a laser-focused review meeting.

### Who can benefit from the Review Dashboard?

Anybody who spearheads a review meeting, or presents the overall OKR progress to the leadership team, can reap the benefit of our Review Dashboard. For instance,

- The **executive team** can periodically facilitate effective strategic reviews with the department heads to review the OKR status at every level of the organization.

- The **department heads** can preside over the tactical review meetings with team managers, and present the department's OKR status to the leadership team during business reviews.

- **Team managers** can use the dashboard to take a quick glance at the OKR progress of each team member, instead of fetching this data manually and creating a presentation from scratch.

- **Individuals** can tailor make this dashboard while having one-on-ones with their respective managers to talk through the accomplishments, priorities, and blockers using real-time data.

### How can I access this dashboard?

1. Every entity has its own dashboard — an organization, a team, and an individual.

2. To view the company-level Review Dashboard, select your **organization’s OKRs** tab from the left pane and select the **Dashboard** tab.

3. To view a team-level Review Dashboard, select **All Teams** from the left pane and select a **team** of your choice, then select the **Dashboard** tab.

4. For Review Dashboards at an individual level, select **My OKRs** from the left pane and select the **Dashboard** tab. To view the dashboard of a user, select **All Users** from the left pane and select a **user** of your choice, then select the **Dashboard** tab.
