Viva Goals Scoring Guidance feature allows users to add guidance for others to see how progress should be tracked and/or how a score should be calculated.

If your organization has Scoring Guidance enabled, users will be able to define how they're tracking progress of an Objective and how to score it at the end of the time period. 

This promotes further transparency and understanding throughout your organization and the progress of your OKRs. 


## Add Scoring Guidance

Scoring Guidance can be added to a new or existing Objective when adding or editing takes place. Simply select **Add scoring guidance**.
