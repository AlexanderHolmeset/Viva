# Removing a user

To remove a user from your organization, an Admin can either deactivate or delete their account. This can be done by navigating to **Admin -> Users**. Find the user you wish to remove and select **Actions -> Deactivate** or **Actions-> Delete**. You'll no longer be billed for the user with both actions.

## Deactivating Vs deleting a user

A deactivated user will remain visible in Viva Goals, but won't be able to sign in. The user will remain assigned as an owner of any OKRs they had. They won't be searchable in **All Users**, and be listed as deactivated in the **Users** section of the admin tools.

You can reactivate a user by choosing **Action-> Make Active** which will restore their ability to sign in.

Deleting a user is a permanent action and can't be undone. Deleting a user will delete all of their activities in the system.

Admins can’t delete users if they’re the current owners of any objective. To delete these users, reassign their OKRs first and then delete the users.
