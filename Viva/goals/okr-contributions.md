# OKR Contributions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## What is OKR contribution
  
Viva Goals’ OKR contribution feature allows users (objective owners and creators) more flexibility and customizability in specifying weights and measuring progress. Users will now be able to define and control contribution at the parent level. All the contributions add up to a total of 100% and objective owners/creators have an option to mark a child’s contribution as fixed. This is available only for OKRs that have progress mode as "Updated via roll-up from key results". 

## Who can manage contribution?

Users who have edit permissions for the OKR (including check-in owners) can edit the contributions of children.

## How to manage OKR contribution
  
1. You can set or edit your OKRs’ contribution from the “More actions” dropdown by selecting the "Manage contributions" option.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can also open the "Manage contributions" modal from the objective quick view by clicking on the objective's title and from the objective's detail view as well.  

2. This opens up the “Manage contributions” dialog box, where you can add or edit contributions of the children (objectives, key results, or projects)   

You can also enable or disable the “Newly aligned items should start contributing by default” toggle. By enabling this, you will allow a newly created child to contribute to the parent. This will readjust the contributions you’d have assigned to each child.

> The “New children should start contributing by default” will be enabled by default. 

3. Once you edit the contributions, click on “Save” to save all the changes.  

## Key points to note: 

1. OKR contribution is available only for OKRs that have progress mode as "Updated via roll-up from key results"

2. All the contributions will add up to a total of 100%. The default contribution is automatically assigned by Ally.io to all the children equally. For example, if an objective has three key results (children), the default contribution assigned to each child will be 33.33%. 

3. As soon as a child’s contribution is edited, the contribution is considered as “Fixed”. This means, if a new child gets added or if an existing child gets removed, the contributions marked as Fixed will not be adjusted. For example, if an objective has three key results (children), and the contribution of the first key result is edited as 50%, the contributions of second and third key result will be automatically adjusted to 25% each. In future, if there is a fourth key result that gets added, only the contribution of the second and third key result will be adjusted. 

You can also reset all the custom contributions to default by clicking the “Reset to default” option.
