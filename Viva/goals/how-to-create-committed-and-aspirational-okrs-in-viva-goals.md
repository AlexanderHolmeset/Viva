# How to create committed and aspirational OKRs in Viva Goals

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

We've introduced a new feature within Viva Goals using which users can create both committed and aspirational goals.

OKR (Objective and key result) methodology supports two types of goals which are described in the following table 


|Goal Name |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Committed OKRs     |   These OKRs are the ones that your organization or team has agreed to execute. These OKRs have a clear action plan on how they would be achieved.      |
|Aspirational OKRs     |    These OKRs are more visionary. These OKRs are stretch goals, and teams are not likely to fully achieve them.    |

Within Viva Goals, users can now switch between aspirational and committed OKRs though OKRs created by default remain aspirational. Committed goals have the tag ‘committed’ which differentiates them from aspirational goals.

The best way to determine whether a goal is aspirational is to check how much of the goal has been attainable. If a user attains 100% of the target and thus closes an objective with a score of 1, the goal isn’t ambitious enough and is marked in "orange". An ideal aspirational OKR or a stretch goal should be challenging but attainable, and a score of 0.7-0.9 is recommended.

With respect to a committed goal, 100% completion ensures a score of 1 and the range is marked in "green", indicating that the user has completed the target which they have committed to achieve.

Here is a short video on how you can set up aspirational and committed OKRs within Viva Goals:

## Scoring Customization

We've also introduced an admin setting where the organization administrator can override the default ranges for the color schemes we have provided for the OKRs. Here, the administrator can configure the scoring ranges against which the color schemes will be mapped.
