## OKR weekly cadence

So you've your OKRs set, the organization is aligned and you've made your first check-ins. Whats Next?

One of the most important parts of the OKR process is developing a weekly cadence to update, review, and track progress of your OKRs. 

We advise incorporating these items into your weekly stand up or team meetings that exist today. 

Setting aside 15 minutes to discuss OKRs once a week will go a long way in OKR adoption and buy-in for your organization. 

### Step 1: Update your OKRs

Ensure your OKRs have the latest information to discuss. Having check-in notifications set up will help keep your team up to date. You can learn more about setting up these notifications [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications). It's best to have these notifications go out at least 24 hours in advance of your scheduled meeting where you'll be discussing OKRs. This way your team can come ready to the meeting with everything up to date.

### Step 2: Review OKRs with the team

In your meetings, discuss the OKRs of the party involved. Identify any that may have been marked Behind or At Risk in the past week and drill-in to understand the details. Additionally you can leave Kudos and Comments directly on OKRs, more on that [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2107055-check-ins-and-feedback). We recommend using the [Chart View](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2375435-chart-view) for these meetings as it will allow you to quickly identify the status of OKRs in a visually pleasing format

### Step 3: Compare progress to previous week

Our "compare to previous" tool is a great trending feature that'll allow you to quickly identify what is moving forward or OKRs that have stalled progress. This tool is a great tool to utilize in your weekly review meetings. With two clicks of a button, you've that information at your finger tips. See instructions for enabling this view [here.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2632032-compare-to-past).

### Step 4: Adjust as necessary

If everything is moving along as expected, great! If not, remember OKRs sometimes need adjustments and that is okay. Make any [edits](https://help.ally.io/articles/3065314-q-can-i-edit-or-delete-a-okr) and reset expectations moving forward. 

That's it! 

In 15 minutes, you've gained a clear picture into: what has moved forward, what's behind, and what has been changed for the coming week for the critical aspects of the business. Comments and Kudos have been left and most importantly your team knows you're tracking their progress, you care about their work, and they can see how it's contributing throughout the company.

Ideally, this transparency is happening at all levels of the company: Organization, Departments, Teams and any Sub-Teams. Each owner of the level would meet with the direct members below, however it may take some time to get all levels involved and that is okay. With each cycle, the number of people wanting to be involved increases.

If you keep this regular rhythm, there's no telling how far OKRs can take you.  

## Weekly OKR meeting tips

### Overall progress

- Discuss check-ins that have been made over the past week using Team or Custom Views.

- Look at change in progress using “Compare to Past” tool. If many objectives have had “nothing new to report” check-ins, this will help identify what’s moving forward and what’s not.

### Objectives going well

- Briefly highlight objectives that have positive change in status or percent completion.

- Praise and Kudos are always welcome. It is especially helpful to point out big wins or large percentage increases week over week. Using “Compare to Past” it will be easy to see these highlights. 

### At risk/behind objectives

- Identify each of these objectives and with their owner, have an open conversation to understand why they are behind/at risk, what is their plan for the coming week, and if any revisions need to be made.

- Ideas and feedback from all team members is helpful in this section to formulate plans for getting back on track.

### Revising objectives

- If the scope of the objective needs to change or the objective needs to be moved into another time period have that conversation here. Editing, Postponing, and Cloning are helpful tools for revising objectives.

- Look to objective owners for their perspective on what the progress means – for example, does an "At Risk" objective need additional resources allocated, should it be reprioritized, or should it perhaps be revised based on new information?  

### Focus for upcoming week

- For each objective and its owner that is incomplete, identify what actions will be taken in the upcoming week to continue progress for the quarter.

- These items can be left as comments on the objective so that others outside this meeting have transparency into the process and what is planned.

### Action items

- Document any other tasks that need to be completed prior to next week’s meeting, you can leave @comments as appropriate within Viva Goals. 

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Goals defines Behind and At Risk as follows:
> - **Behind**: Progress is less than you want currently but there is a plan or idea of how to get back on track.
> - **At Risk**: Progress is less than you want and there is no plan for how to move forward or get back on track.
> - If the status is being auto calculated by the progress of the key results:
>   - Behind will be: % is between 10-25% below expected progress. 
>   - At Risk is: % is >25% below expected progress.
