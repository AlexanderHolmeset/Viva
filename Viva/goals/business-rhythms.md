# Set up OKR business rhythms

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

## 1. Set up a weekly cadence to check-in with OKRs

One of the most important parts of the OKR process is developing a weekly cadence to update, review, and track progress of your OKRs. 

We advise incorporating these items into your weekly stand-up or team meetings that exist today. 

Setting aside 15 minutes to discuss OKRs once a week will go a long way in OKR adoption and buy-in for your organization. 

### Update your OKRs

Ensure your OKRs have the latest information to discuss. Having check-in notifications set up will help keep your team up to date. You can learn more about setting up these notifications [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2377894-check-in-reminders-and-notifications). 

It's best to have these notifications go out at least 24 hours in advance of your scheduled meeting where you'll be discussing OKRs. This way your team can come ready to the meeting.

### Review OKRs with the team

In your meetings, identify any OKRs marked Behind or At Risk in the past week and drill down to understand details. Additionally you can engage directly with OKRs in Viva Goals via likes and comments: [here](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2107055-check-ins-and-feedback). 

We recommend using the [Chart View](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2375435-chart-view) for these meetings, as it will allow you to quickly identify the status of OKRs in a visually pleasing format.

### Compare progress to previous week

Our "compare to previous" tool is a great trending feature that'll allow you to quickly identify what is moving forward or OKRs that have stalled progress. This tool is a great tool to utilize in your weekly review meetings. With two clicks of a button, you've that information at your finger tips. See instructions for enabling this view [here.](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2632032-compare-to-past).

### Adjust as necessary

If everything is moving along as expected, great! If not, remember OKRs sometimes need adjustments. Make any [edits](https://help.ally.io/articles/3065314-q-can-i-edit-or-delete-a-okr) and reset expectations moving forward. 

In 15 minutes, you've gained a clear picture into what has moved forward, what is behind, and what has been changed for the coming week for the critical aspects of the business. You've engaged on your team and company's biggest goals and your team can see their progress and how it is contributing.

## 2. Set up summary updates

Get summarized OKR progress and status updates for the company, teams or individuals delivered to emails.  

### Following an entity

To start receiving summary updates, begin by following the company, a team or individual. You can follow as many teams or individuals as you like by visiting the respective OKR dashboard page available from the navigation menu.
