# Slack Integration 

## Introduction to Slack integration

Slack users can now leverage the Viva Goals app for Slack to bring OKRs into their daily tooling. The Viva Goals app enables quick and seamless integration with Slack so that your team can add and update their OKRs without ever having to leave Slack. Additionally, notifications in Slack ensure you never miss an OKR update again. 

Within the Viva Goals app, users now have the following capabilities within Slack: 

- **Get OKR updates** – Users timely receive OKR and project updates from a team, team member, or an organization
- **Check-in** - Users can make check-ins to their OKRs and projects.
- **Manage OKRs** - Users can create new OKRs or make edits to existing ones

## Configuring Slack Integration 

To link your Slack workspace with Viva Goals, navigate to Admin > Integrations > Slack in your Viva Goals account. Click on **Add to Slack**. Next, select the workplace from the top right corner of the page, and click on **Authorize**.

Once Viva Goals is connected to your Slack workspace, all team members will see the Viva Goals app under **Apps** where they can view, add, or update OKRs. 

## Check-in reminders for your team and organization

Depending upon the OKR check-in cadences, team manager or admin can set all the team members receive check-in reminders for OKRs in Slack and allow them to update on OKRs and projects directly from Slack

## Configure Slack workspace to receive OKR updates 

As an admin, you can configure what OKR updates you’d like your team to be notified on.  To receive notification from OKR updates, Navigate to Admin > Integrations > Slack and click on **Manage**. 

To set up notifications, click on **Add Notification**. In the pop-up that appears, choose: 

1. **Send To:** Choose a channel or a person where the notifications will be sent. 
2. **Entities:** Select which Viva Goals team or user you want to get notifications for. 
3. **Events:** Select from an array of options when you’d like to receive notification. For example, you can set up notifications for check-ins or when an OKR is updated.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/slack-images/notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Slack notification settings within Viva Goals." lightbox="../media/goals/slack-images/notification.png":::

All updates to a team's or user's OKRs and projects will be delivered to Slack as notifications depending on the admin notification settings for that team or user.

## Share OKR summary via Slack
