# Slack Integration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals allows quick and easy integration with Slack so that your team can add and update Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) without having to switch away. Moreover, notifications in Slack ensure you never miss an OKR update again.

Once Viva Goals and Slack are integrated, users can do the following things from within Slack:

- **View OKRs** - Users can view their own OKRs, those of the team, a team member or of the organization.

- **Add/Edit Objectives** - Users can create new Objectives or make edits to existing ones.

- **Check-in** - Users can make check-ins to their Objectives including postponing or closing.

## Why Slack?

- **Easy update**: The integration allows users to add new OKRs or check-ins in seconds directly in Slack, without any context switch.

- **Timely notifications**: Users can receive notifications in Slack real-time and stay on top of OKR updates.

- **Stay connected**: A private channel created between a user and their manager/reportee improves collaboration.

## How to configure Slack?

To link your Slack workspace with Viva Goals, navigate to **Admin > Integrations > Slack** in your Viva Goals account and select **Add to Slack**. Next, select the workplace from the top right corner of the page, and select **Authorize**.

Once linked to your Slack workspace, all team members would see the Viva Goals bot under **Apps**. This is where they can view, add or update OKRs.

## How to receive updates in Slack?

As an admin, you can configure for what events your team receives updates on in Slack. Navigate to **Admin > Integrations > Slack** and select **Manage**.

To set up notifications, select **Add Notification**. In the popup that appears, select:

1. **Send To**: Select a channel or a person to whom the notifications would be published.

2. **Entities**: Select which type of OKRs the notifications belong to - the organization’s, a specific team’s or an individual’s.

3. **Events**: Select from an array of options when you’d like to publish the notification - during a check-in or when an Objective is closed.
