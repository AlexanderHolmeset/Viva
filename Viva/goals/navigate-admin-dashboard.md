Organization Admins have a special role within their organization’s OKR 
program. Organization Admins will help set up the organization, time periods, 
users and teams in the Viva Goals instance. To complete these actions, please 
visit the Admin Dashboard in your solution instance. To access the Viva Goals 
Admin Dashboard, navigate toward the bottom of the left side panel and select 
“Admin” next to the gear icon.

Inside the Admin Dashboard, you will see different tabs where you can make 
adjustments, including Settings, Users, Teams, Time Periods, Notifications, 
Integrations, OKR Model Configuration, and OKRs & Projects.

## Here is what you will find in each of the tabs in the Admin Dashboard

- **Settings:** Here is where you can establish solution permissions for your 
organization’s instance of Viva Goals.

- **Users:** In this tab, you can manage settings related to users. Click on the 
ellipses next to a user to see options like deactivate, edit, make admin, transfer 
ownership, delete, and export.

- **Teams:** This tab shows all the teams you have set up plus the team owner and 
members. You can add new teams by selecting the “Add Team” button. To 
modify team settings, select the ellipses next to a given team. 

- **Notifications:** Customize the notifications that are sent to employees from the 
solution. Here you can set the frequency, days, and time of check-in reminders. 
Integrations: In this tab, admins can configure the applications they want to 
integrate with their organization’s Viva Goals instance.

- **OKR Model Configuration:** Here, admins can configure the OKR model for their 
organization and enable projects.

- **OKRs & Projects:** Admins can determine whether they want to allow multiple 
teams & owners to collaborate on key objectives & projects. Admins can also 
establish OKR approval settings here.
