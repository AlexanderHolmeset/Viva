Organization Admins have a special role within their organization’s OKR 
program. Organization Admins will help set up the organization, time periods, 
users and teams in the Viva Goals instance. To complete these actions, please 
visit the Admin Dashboard in your solution instance. To access the Viva Goals 
Admin Dashboard, navigate toward the bottom of the left side panel and select 
“Admin” next to the gear icon.

Inside the Admin Dashboard, you will see different tabs where you can make 
adjustments, including Settings, Users, Teams, Time Periods, Notifications, 
Integrations, OKR Model Configuration, and OKRs & Projects.

## Here is what you will find in each of the tabs in the Admin Dashboard

Settings: Here is where you can establish solution permissions for your 
organization’s instance of Viva Goals.

Users: In this tab, you can manage settings related to users. Click on the 
ellipses next to a user to see options like deactivate, edit, make admin, transfer 
ownership, delete, and export.

Teams: This tab shows all the teams you have set up plus the team owner and 
members. You can add new teams by selecting the “Add Team” button. To 
modify team settings, select the ellipses next to a given team. 

Notifications: Customize the notifications that are sent to employees from the 
solution. Here you can set the frequency, days, and time of check-in reminders. 
Integrations: In this tab, admins can configure the applications they want to 
integrate with their organization’s Viva Goals instance.

OKR Model Configuration: Here, admins can configure the OKR model for their 
organization and enable projects.

OKRs & Projects: Admins can determine whether they want to allow multiple 
teams & owners to collaborate on key objectives & projects. Admins can also 
establish OKR approval settings here.

Adopting new technology brings change, and change can be daunting. We 
recommend Organization Admins read through this easy-to-follow guide that 
will walk you through the steps of deploying Viva Goals for your organization.

## Help employees thrive with an employee experience platform

mployee expectations have never been higher. Top talent can write their own ticket and 
choose where they work. Yet HR leaders face the challenge of driving engagement, learning, 
wellbeing, and growth wherever employees are getting work done.

To recruit, retain, and upskill workers, the right technology can be critical. As this data shows, 
companies that have an integrated platform vouch for its ability to support these bottom line business goals. For organizations that want to become an employer of choice, pay and benefits simply aren’t enough. It’s the employee experience that makes the difference.
