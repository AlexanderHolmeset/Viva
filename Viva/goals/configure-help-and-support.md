As an organization administrator, you can configure help and support resources for users in your organization. These will appear in the help section for users:

## How to configure help and support

To configure the help and support options, go to **Admin Dashboard** -> **Settings tab** -> **Help and support** setting and enable support using the toggle.

On enabling the configuration, you will be able to: 

1. Change the menu item name which will appear in the help menu. Default is “<your org name> help”. 

2. You can also update the tooltip text to something more suitable if required. This can guide your users on when to use these resources. 

3. Add contact information. It can be of two types 

    a. Links – these can be links to an MS Teams channel, ticketing system or other help resources. You can include a name to describe what the users should expect in the link. 

    b. Contacts – You can specify the contact's name or description. You can add email, phone number, or any other kind of contact information. Use comma to separate different kinds of contact information, so that they will appear in different lines. You can add up to 5 lines for a contact.

As you make the changes, you will be able to see a live preview of how it will appear to the users. 
  
:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/add-contact-info-page.png" alt-text="Enter the contact information and view the preview of how it will apeear." lightbox="../media/goals/add-contact-info-page.png":::
  
You can add multiple links and contacts.

On saving, the menu will start appearing in the help section for users of your organization.

## Disable help and support 

You can use the toggle to disable help and support resources configured by you. You will be shown a prompt to confirm. On confirmation, the help resources configured by you will disappear from the help menu. 

Note: You will lose the configuration once you disable help and support.
