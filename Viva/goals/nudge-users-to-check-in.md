# Nudge users to check in

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. Viva Goals is only being released to WW tenants. It isn't being released to GCC, GCC High, or DoD environments. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

In Viva Goals, you can "nudge" a user to check in or update an OKR. Access this option from the progress icon on the left side of the progress bar on the OKR/project list.

The nudge option is visible to all users who aren't the primary check-in owner of the OKR.

The nudge goes out to the user's email.
