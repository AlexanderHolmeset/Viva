# Nudge users to check in

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

When an OKR or Projects needs an update and you want to leave a comment specifically as a reminder to check in or update the OKR, you can now select the progress icon on the left of the progress bar on the OKR/Project list, and nudge the person who is responsible for making the check-ins.

The nudge option is available in the progress popover when you select it. It will be visible to the users who aren't the primary check-in owner of the OKR.

The nudge will go out to the user's email.
