# Nudge users to check in

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Whenever an Objectives and Key Results (OKR)/Project needs an update and you want to leave a comment specifically as a reminder to check in or update the OKR, you can now select the progress icon on the left of the progress bar on the OKR/Project list, and nudge the person who is responsible for making the check-ins.

The nudge option is available in the progress popover when you select it. It will be visible to the users who aren't the primary check-in owner of the OKR.

In the popup, you can also see how the notifications for that particular user are configured and where they'll be notified. The nudge will go out on Slack if integrated for their account, otherwise, it will fall back to email.
