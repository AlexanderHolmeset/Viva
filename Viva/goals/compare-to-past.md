The compare to past feature makes it easy to see the progress made on OKRs at a glance. Select the **Compare to past** button located in your dashboard and select the time frame you would like to compare to. You can choose from the previous day, week, month or select a custom date for comparison.

Once you have chosen your time frame, you will notice the old progress bars beneath the current ones. We recommend using compare to past in combination with detailed view to get a full picture of the progress that has been made.
