# Objective Delegation

Viva Goals’ Objective Delegation feature allows objective owners to delegate another individual to manage OKRs on their behalf in Viva Goals.

## What is OKR Delegation?

There may be times when you are using OKRs to collaborate with other people within your organization and you need to delegate OKRs to another individual to manage on behalf of the OKR owner. With Viva Goals’ Delegation option, you can assign another individual to manage and work on OKRs that aren't owned by them.

## Add a Delegate to an Objective

Users may add a delegate to an objective when creating or editing an objective.

## The difference between a Delegate and a Check-In Owner

A delegate gets permissions to edit all aspects of an OKR except the ownership, whereas a **check-in** owner can only check in manually or set up an auto integration. A delegate works on behalf of the OKR owner on a specific objective, while the check-in owner only updates the progress of an objective on behalf of an owner.

If you want a user within the organization to check in and update the progress of an OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set up a data link on the OKR (to auto-check-in). This user will be receiving the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, this will prevent all of the owners from receiving reminders, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

### Steps to assign responsibility for check-ins

- Log in to Viva Goals and select the **+** button on the top panel to create a new OKR.

- Once you enter the objective/Key Result and want to share it with another individual, select owners from the **Owner** option. Here you can assign multiple owners for the OKR.

- Once you assign an owner, select the user who will be responsible for making check-ins from the **Who is responsible for making check-ins?** drop-down.

- Once you make the selection, the user will start receiving the check-in reminders.

By default, the owner (the first owner in the case of multiple owners) is set as the person responsible for check-in and users need not explicitly choose unless necessary.

If you have an enterprise subscription and would like to have this enabled for your organization, have an account admin reach out to [support@gotoally.com](mailto:support@gotoally.com) with the request.
