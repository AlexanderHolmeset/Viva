As an admin user of Viva Goals, you'll have the ability to work on behalf of other users. This privilege will allow you to assume the sign in of other individuals in order to add OKRs, make Check-ins, or score OKRs on their behalf. This privilege can be useful when setting up Viva Goals, or if someone is away and is unable to take the action by self.

   You'll be taken to **My OKRs** menu item for the individual you selected.

   For example, any action I take now will be reflected in the system as though Ashley took that action. All activity feeds will reflect accordingly. This scenario is depicted in the following image:

## When to use the Work on Behalf feature

The Work on Behalf feature is great to have when an admin user needs to set up a new Viva Goals user with OKRs before giving that person access to the system.

It can be helpful when an OKR needs updating and the owner is out on leave or away.

It's a great way to troubleshoot when a user thinks something is missing or is unable to take a certain action. When you work on behalf of a user, you also get the user's views and permission; so you can help them find or understand what they're experiencing.

> [!NOTE]
> *If your account has the enterprise feature Private Objectives enabled, you can't work on behalf of a user with Private Objectives.*
