# Work on behalf of another user 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

As an admin for Viva Goals, you have the ability to work on behalf of other users. This privilege will allow you to assume the sign in of other individuals in order to add OKRs, make check-ins, or score OKRs on their behalf. This privilege can be useful when setting up Viva Goals, or if someone is away and is unable to take the action by self.

## How to use the Work on Behalf feature

To use Work on Behalf feature, perform the following steps:

1. Choose **Admin > Users**.

2. Choose **Action > Work on Behalf**.

You will be taken to **My OKRs** menu item for the individual you selected.
 
3. Select **Stop Work on Behalf** in the yellow banner at the bottom of the screen to navigate back to your admin account.

## When to use the Work on Behalf feature

The Work on Behalf feature is great to have when an admin needs to set up a new Viva Goals user with OKRs before giving that person access to the system.

It can be helpful when an OKR needs updating and the owner is out on leave or away.

It is also a great way to troubleshoot when a user thinks something is missing or is unable to take a certain action. When you work on behalf of a user, you also get the user's views and permission, so you can help them find a solution or understand what they're experiencing.

> [!NOTE]
> *If your account has the feature Private Objectives enabled, you can't work on behalf of a user with Private Objectives.*
