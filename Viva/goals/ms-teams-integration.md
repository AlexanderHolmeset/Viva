# Microsoft Teams integration

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

You can use Viva Goals to manage your OKRs directly within Microsoft Teams.

Our quick and easy integration enables users to add, update, and manage OKRs within the context of their daily workflow. You can also access multiple OKR views by pinning a tab inside chats or channels.

## How to pre-install Viva Goals for users within Microsoft Teams?

As a Microsoft Teams administrator, you can now pre-install the Viva Goals app directly from your MS Teams account. To do this, you need to be a tenant admin with access to admin.teams.microsoft.com.

Follow these steps to successfully pre-install Viva Goals:

1. Log in to https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/ with your user id and password.
1. Click on Setup policies and choose App setup policies.
1. Choose the policy that is associated with the segment of users you want the Viva Goals bot to be pre-installed for. If you want to pre-install Viva Goals for all users in your tenant, choose the Global(Org-wide-default) option.
1. Under the installed apps section, click on the ‘Add Apps’ button and Add Viva Goals.
