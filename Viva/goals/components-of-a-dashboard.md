## What does a Dashboard comprise of?

A Dashboard can house multiple panels, and each panel comprises seven types of widgets — Objectives and Key Results (OKR) detail, custom embed, OKR list, text block, key performance indicator (KPI) list, image, and project list. You can customize this dashboard with any number of panels and widgets of your choice, depending on the need – executive business reviews, departmental meetings, tactical review meetings, and likewise.

## Types of widgets — purpose and creation

There are seven types of widgets, and each panel can have innumerable permutations and combinations of the below-mentioned widgets:

### OKR list

- This widget comes handy when you want to briefly summarize the progress made since the last review cycle.

- You can list objectives by filtering them based on the time period, entity, and status. This list will set the stage for your review meeting by displaying the objectives that you want to discuss about. For instance, to identify objectives that require attention, you can filter them based on the status to display OKRs that are at risk, and behind.

- The Key Updates section on the left allows you to provide the narrative for the progress updates. These updates will ensure that every member across all the levels of the organization are on the same page in terms of the progress made by each entity.

- In case of shared OKRs, you can view the OKR progress of the dependent teams, instead of switching back and forth between each entity’s OKRs.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the objective list widget, and provide a name for this widget.

- The next step is to start adding objectives to this widget. You can add objectives either automatically based on the rules you define, or manually by handpicking the objectives. Further, you can filter these objectives based on the time period, entity it belongs to, and the status.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you choose to add objectives automatically based on the predefined rules, any objective that meets the criteria will be added to the list automatically. You don't have to rework on the list every time before your review. For example, if you want to review only the OKRs that are at risk, you can define this rule, and any time an objective becomes at risk, it will be added to the list automatically, and will not go unnoticed. However, if you want to review significant OKRs irrespective of the status, or entity, or time period, you can select such objectives manually, and review the progress during each meeting.

- In addition, you can add the Key Updates section, include the summary changes, and append the progress trend graph.

- Save and add the widget.

### OKR detail

- You can choose any particular objective to take the center stage, and dive deep into the progress of each key result.

- This widget provides a granular analysis of the progress of each key result using the RAG status indicators (Red, Amber, Green), which will help you in understanding the daily progress of key results. You can quickly get to the root cause, and take necessary steps to bring the key result back on track.

- The Key Updates section on the left allows you to provide the narrative for the progress updates of the chosen objective. You can talk through the challenges, and the plan forward to get back on track.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the objective detail widget.

- The next step is to add a specific objective to this widget. You can filter the objectives based on the time period, and entity it belongs to.

- You can choose to include the progress graph, and recent check-ins made on the chosen objective. In addition, you can list all the key results pertaining to this objective.

- Save and add the widget.

### Custom embed

- Your OKRs could be connected to any third-party tool. More often than not, you find yourself switching back and forth to pull data from these tools during your OKR review meetings.

- Say, you rely on data visualization tools or spreadsheets to track the progress of specific metrics. You can bring them all under a single roof, in the context of OKR progress. You can add anything that’s embeddable — a URL, image, or an HTML to populate data within the Review Dashboard.

- This gives you greater control over customizing the dashboard to incorporate KPIs, trends, projects, and visualizations in a consolidated view that catalyzes laser-focused meetings.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the custom embed widget, and provide a name for this widget.

- Enter either the URL or HTML, and check for the preview.

- Save and add the widget.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **1. Dashboards Do Not Render Properly in Safari Browser**
>
> When using embedded URLs within a dashboard, you may be running into issues (errors such as **'refused to connect'**) in the Safari browser. This may be due to Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention to block third-party tracking cookies (even though Viva Goals is not a tracking domain). Use a different browser to access Viva Goals Software. If you still face issues with a different browser, check for the privacy settings.

> Read more about Intelligent Tracking Prevention [here](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/). You can learn more about Safari’s cross-site tracking setting [here.](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/prevent-cross-site-tracking-sfri40732/mac)  
>
> **2. No support for RAW HTML**  
>
> Viva Goals does not support raw HTML embed and currently only accepts a valid full URL. If the format of the input is not a valid URL, you'll see an error message that reads `Enter a valid URL`.

### Text block

- This is a rich-text editor wherein you can jot down supporting notes and add descriptive comments for the OKRs.

- You can include screenshots here to substantiate your data, if need be.

- This widget is an avenue for you to provide additional information, and talk through important points during OKR review meetings.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the text block widget.

- Use the formatting options for better presentation of the text within this widget.

- Save, and add the widget.

### KPI list

- The KPI widget will let you highlight the key metrics, and review the progress of these metrics over time.

- There are two views of the KPI widget — tabular view, and the grid view. Grid view will provide you with the much-needed bird's-eye view on the numbers, and the progress update since the last review cycle. The table view, on the other hand, will let you analyze the daily progress made on the KPI. You can seamlessly switch between the views based on your requirement.

- You can filter KPIs based on the time period, and entity. For better context, the associated objective will also be displayed in this widget for each KPI.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the KPI widget, and provide a name for this widget.

- The next step is to start adding KPIs to this widget. You can add KPIs either automatically based on the rules you define, or manually by handpicking them. Further, you can filter these key metrics based on the time period, and the entity it belongs to.

- Select how you want to view the KPIs – either in grid view or the list view.

- In addition, you can select to display the objective that's linked with the KPI for better context.

- Save, and add the widget.

### Image

- A picture is worth a thousand words! The image widget can be used for embedding images, and GIFs in the context of your OKRs.

- To enhance the presentation of your progress updates, you can leverage the image widget to insert images of any format, save yourself from the hassle of creating complicated tabular columns, or typing lengthy updates.

- You can have control over the size and positioning of the chosen images in the dashboard.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the image widget, and provide a name for this widget.

- The next step is to add images — you can either drag and drop an image, or upload from your local computer.

- Once you've previewed the image in the popover, determine the image size — stretch to fit the width, or the height.

- Save, and add the widget.

### Project list

- Projects are initiatives teams and users execute to achieve key results. When you connect these projects to the overarching goals, employees see the big picture on how their work is driving progression toward company goals.

- To ensure teams work on the right projects that drive results, it's important to bring focus on Projects into your business rhythms. When you periodically review Projects in the context of OKRs, you gain greater visibility into work that’s driving OKR progression.

- Review Projects with the help of check-in notes, and the week-on-week progress and status.

To create this widget,

- From the list of available options, select the project list widget, and provide a name for this widget.

- You can filter and select projects based on the time period, entity, and the status of projects.

- Save, and add the widget.
