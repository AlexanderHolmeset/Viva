# What happens when I archive a team?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Once a team is archived, you'll no longer be able to create OKRs/projects under that team and users will no longer be a part of the team. Additionally, any subteams will then become independent teams in Viva Goals. All OKRs that were previously assigned to the archived teams will still be accessible for actions to be performed on them, such as, check-ins.

Even though you won't be able to see the team under **All Teams** now, you can see the assigned OKRs on expanding the parent OKRs theyâ€™re aligned to. You'll also be able to view these OKRs/projects in the Explorer by applying the type filter and selecting the archived team name.

However, the activities related to the specific team will be halted, for example, assigning team members, team-level notifications, and so on, which can easily be resumed at any point by unarchiving the team, if necessary.
