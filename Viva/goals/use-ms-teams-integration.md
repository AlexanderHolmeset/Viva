The **My OKRs** tab shows you OKRs assigned to you. 

1. If you are part of multiple Viva Goals organizations, you can view your OKRs for each organization using the ‘organization switcher’ on the top left.

To maintain your alignment to top level OKRs, the **Organization OKRs** tab will show you your organization’s top level OKRs. Similar to the My OKRs tab, you can select these items to view details. You can even edit and check-in on them if you are one of the OKR owners.

<h2 id="find-okrs-in-teams">How to find OKRs in Microsoft Teams</h2>

On both the **My OKRs** and **Organization OKRs** tabs, you can search for any OKRs on the top right. You can use this to view any team’s OKRs, or search for OKRs by name. This is a powerful way to quickly understand what other teams in your organization are focused on.
