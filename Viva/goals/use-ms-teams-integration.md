<h2 id="view-org-okrs-in-teams">How to view organization OKRs in Microsoft Teams</h2>
         
To maintain your alignment to top-level OKRs, the **Organization OKRs** tab shows your organization's top level OKRs. As with the **My OKRs** tab, you can select these items to view details. You can even edit and check in on them if you're one of the OKR owners.

<h2 id="find-okrs-in-teams">How to find OKRs in Microsoft Teams</h2>

On both the **My OKRs** and **Organization OKRs** tabs, you can search for any OKRs from the upper-right corner. You can use this to view any team's OKRs or search for OKRs by name. This is a powerful way to quickly see what other teams in your organization are focused on.
