# Follow Organizations, Teams and Users 

In order to keep track of OKRs that are relevant to you, Viva Goals provides a two-step process that delivers this information right to your inbox.

## Step 1: Follow

To follow organizations, teams, and users that are important to you, select the **Follow** icon on one of these entities.

For example, you can follow East Coast Sales to receive updates from that team. The icon will turn green to indicate you're now **Following** it.

By default, Viva Goals will have you follow:

- The organization

- Teams you're part of

- Teams you own

- Parent teams of your teams

- Teams owned by your reportees

## Step 2: Receive Updates

Once you're following one or more organizations, teams, or users, Viva Goals will automatically notify you via email with you a weekly progress update showing Objective activity, what's going well, and what's not going well.

To view or unfollow your organizations, teams, or users:

1. Select your user name

2. Select **Edit settings**

3. Select the Following Tab

4. Select the **Unfollow** button

This will let you adjust which organizations, teams, and users that you receive updates from.
