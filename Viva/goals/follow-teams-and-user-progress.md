> [!IMPORTANT]

As your company scales, there can often be many interesting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that are created across an organization.

In order to keep track of various goals that are relevant to you, Viva Goals provides a two step process that delivers this information right to your inbox or via Slack.

## Step 1: Follow

To follow organizations, teams, and users that are important to you, select the **Follow** icon on one of these entities.

For example, you can follow East Coast Sales to receive updates from that team. The icon will turn green to indicate you're now **Following** it.

By default, Viva Goals will have you follow:

- The organization

- Teams you're part of

- Teams you own

- Parent teams of your teams

- Teams owned by your reportees

## Step 2: Receive Updates

Once you're following one or more organizations, teams, or users, Viva Goals will automatically notify you via Slack or email you a weekly progress update showing Objective activity, what's going well, and what's not going well.

To view or unfollow your organizations, teams, or users:

1. Select your user name

2. Select **Edit settings**

3. Select the Following Tab

4. Select the **Unfollow** button

This will let you adjust which organizations, teams, and users that you receive updates from.

By following appropriate teams and receiving progress updates, you'll be poised to react in an agile manner to relevant OKR articles and achieve success.
