OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a management tool that allows collaborative goal setting for employees, with close alignment to the organization's goals. The keys to success with OKRs are transparency and alignment. Right from the CEO to managers and colleagues, an employee can view anyoneâ€™s OKRs in the system. This undisguised transparency fosters openness and removes conflicts and redundancies with work. OKRs are also aligned vertically and horizontally, allowing employees to see how their work connects with the organization's overall strategic goals.

**Objectives** are goals you want achieved. They're meaningful, specific, action oriented, and aspirational. Objectives are added at the organizational, teams, and individual levels.

The example of objectives added at organizational and teams levels is depicted in the following image:

**Key results** are tasks or actions that help you reach your objectives. They're measurable, time bound, aggressive, yet realistic. When all key results are met, the objective is necessarily achieved.

For best results, teams and individuals should be aligned well in a hierarchy. Key results at one level become objectives of the next level.

**Check-ins** are updates you make to share progress on your OKRs. When you update progress on a key result, it automatically updates the status of the parent objective(s) as appropriate.

## Are OKRs a good fit for you?

In most cases, the answer is a resounding **Yes**. OKRs are beneficial for any organization that cares about operational excellence, bringing alignment to their goal-setting process. If you're a small team, the tool helps employees work toward the focused goals with agility. If you're a large organization, it's even more important that all teams align with the common goals of the organization.
