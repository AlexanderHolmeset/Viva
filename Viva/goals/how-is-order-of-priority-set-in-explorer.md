You can sort your Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) in order of your priority in Explorer.

This refers to the order in which the OKRs are arranged i.e. their order in the Entity (Organization/Team/Individual) OKR view. For example: If you have OKRs arranged in a certain manner on your page and want to see the same priority order in Explorer, you can use this option.  

If you're looking to change the order of OKRs based on your priority, see [Reordering OKRs](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/3096382-drag-and-drop-reordering-okrs).
