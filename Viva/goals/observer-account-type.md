# Observer account type

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals supports two kinds of accounts:
- **Regular Users**: Regular users can access all of Viva Goals' functionality, including creating, updating, and owning OKRs. They can take up additional responsibilities in Viva Goals such as an administrator, team administrator, manager, and so on.

- **Observers**: As opposed to regular users, Observers can't create, edit, or own OKRs. However, they can view all entities and OKRs like regular users. ([Learn more](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/4200915-observer-account-type).)

Observers' licenses are typically priced lower than the licenses of regular users. Using Observer licenses is a cost-effective way for organizations to get the benefits of transparency, alignment, and remote collaboration.

Using Viva Goals with Observer privileges is described in the following image:

## Privileges of an Observer

An Observer is entitled to the following privileges:

- **Seeing all entities' OKRs**: This privilege enables an Observer to be aware of, and aligned to, organization’s, teams’, and users’ priorities, progress, and updates.
- **Following entities**: This privilege enables an Observer to receive updates for any entities and stay updated to latest developments.
- **Liking and commenting**: This privilege enables an Observer to like and comment on OKRs, check-in, and activity feed updates to engage with leadership team.

> [!NOTE]
> Observers can’t be an OKR owner, administrator, or Team owner/administrator. However, they can be team members, managers, and can have a Manager.

## Obtaining licenses of an Observer

To enable Observer feature, contact Microsoft Support.

## Adding users as an Observer

You can set a default account type for new users from **Admin Dashboard > Setting**. If the value is set to **Observer**, users will take up account type as **Observer** when added through file upload/slack or when they join without invitations (if allowed).

The process of adding a user as an Observer is depicted in the following image:
