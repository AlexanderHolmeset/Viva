With the Viva Goals OKR and Microsoft Teams integration, you can't get way more out of your Microsoft Teams app! In this article we will go over how to add the Viva Goals app to your workspace, how to add new objectives, and how to update your progress, without ever leaving MS Teams!

## Pinning a tab to a chart or channel

You can easily pin an OKR dashboard as a tab to any chat or channel in MS Teams. To do this task: 

1. Select the desired chat or channel you would like the tab to appear.

## Adding new objectives

Adding a new objective inside Teams is easy. To do this task:

1. Open any OKR view and Click **+ Add Objective**.

## Adding key results

After adding an objective, and clicking **Save and Add Key Result**, the **Add Key Result** window will appear. On this page, you can add your key result, assign tags, add description, choose how you would like to measure success, add scoring guidance, a data integration, choose how to align, adjust owner, delegate and adjust time period. 

Once you have completed this information, you can **Save and Close**, or choose to **Save and Add Another**.

## Performing OKR check-ins

To perform an OKR update in Teams:

1. Select the **My OKRs** tab. Once here, scroll down to the OKR you wish to update and Click the **Check-in** button. The process for updating objectives and key results are the same.

2. When the **New check-in** page appears, fill in the current progress and click **Check in**.

One you click **Check-in**, the progress of the objective or key result will adjust to reflect the recent check-in.
