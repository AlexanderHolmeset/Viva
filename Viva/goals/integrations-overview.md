# Integrations overview

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals features integrations with industry-leading tools and platforms to make your OKR implementation as simple, effective and seamless as possible. Don’t switch away from the tools you love, and don’t waste time switching back and forth: use integrations to automatically update OKRs when your work gets done and foster ongoing feedback around your goals.

## Enabling integrations

To enable integrations, navigate to **Admin > Integrations** and select **Enable** to activate a specific integration.

## Viewing integrations

When you're inside the integrations page inside the admin section, there are a couple of views that we support for you to view all the different integrations we have — list view, and grid view. 

The list view is a clean and compact view of all the integrations with a clear call-to-action button for either enabling or managing the integration. The grid view is a detail-driven view that provides link to the corresponding help article, and allows you to contact our support, if need be. You will have the grid view by default, and toggle between the views.

You can toggle between the two views by clicking on the icons from the top-right corner of the page.

## Creating connections

To set up a connection, click **Enable** on the integration you'd like to set up a connection for and follow the on-screen setup steps. 

Remember that only admins can edit the connections others have created. Connections can either be made public (usable by everyone in the organization) or private by toggling the ‘Share connection’ checkbox. Users will be able to see their private connections followed by public connections (if any).

## Data update frequency

Viva Goals will check for new data about once per hour. 

You can also trigger a sync manually and instantly by:

1. Clicking on the integration icon next to the progress bar of an OKR or Project.

2. Click refresh symbol.

To do this, make sure the OKR or project is already integrated with one of the integration tools.

## Editing an integration

As of today, there are three way to edit an integration:

A. Against a specific Key Result, click on the **More Actions icon > Edit**; you'll find an option to **Edit** the integration right under the dropdown menu of **Connect data source to auto-update progress**. 

B. For a more simpler way to edit the integration, right next to the progress bar, click on **Integrations icon** and select **Edit integration** from the popover window. 

C. From the quick-view window, click on the **Integrations icon**  and select **Edit integration**.

## Disabling an integration

To disable an integration, click on **Manage**, then select **Disable integration** from the **Change** dropdown. 

> [!NOTE]
> OKRs currently using the connection will no longer be able to sync.
