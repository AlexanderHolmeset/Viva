# Viva Goals integrations overview

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers, and only in English. The features described here are subject to change. Viva Goals is only being released to WW tenants, and that it is not being released to GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)

Viva Goals offers integrations with industry-leading tools and platforms you use every day so that your OKR implementation process is as simple, effective and seamless as possible. Don’t switch away from the tools you love, and don’t waste time switching back and forth: use integrations to automatically update OKRs when your work gets done and foster ongoing feedback around your goals.

## How to enable integrations 

To enable integrations, navigate to **Admin > Integrations** and select **Enable** to activate a specific integration.

## How to view integrations 

When you are at the integrations page within the admin section, there are a two views we support for you to view all the different integrations we have: list view and grid view. 

The list view is a clean and compact view of all integrations with a clear call-to-action button for either enabling or managing the integration. 

The grid view is a detail-driven view that provides links to the corresponding help article, and allows you to contact support if necessary. 

You will have the grid view by default, and can toggle between the two views by clicking on the icons from the top-right corner of the page.

## How to create connections

To set up a connection, click **Enable** on the integration you would like to set up a connection for, and follow the on-screen setup steps. 

**Remember that only admins can edit the connections others have created.** 

Connections can either be made public (usable by everyone in the organization) or private by toggling the ‘Share connection’ checkbox. Users will be able to see their private connections followed by public connections (if any).

## Data update frequency for integrations 

Viva Goals will check for new data about once per hour. 

You can also trigger a sync manually and instantly by:

1. Clicking on the integration icon next to the progress bar of an OKR or Project.

2. Click refresh symbol.

To do this, make sure the OKR or project is already integrated with one of the integration tools.

## How to edit an integration

There are three way to edit an integration:

A. Against a specific Key Result, click on the **More Actions icon > Edit**; you will find an option to **Edit** the integration under the dropdown menu of **Connect data source to auto-update progress**. 

B. For a simpler way to edit the integration, right next to the progress bar, click on **Integrations icon** and select **Edit integration** from the popover window. 

C. From the quick-view window, click on the **Integrations icon**  and select **Edit integration**.

## How to disable an integration

To disable an integration, click on **Manage**, then select **Disable integration** from the **Change** dropdown. 

> [!NOTE]
> OKRs currently using the connection will no longer be able to sync.
