# Viva Goals integrations overview

Viva Goals offers integrations with industry-leading tools and platforms you use every day, so your OKR implementation process is as simple, effective, and seamless as possible. Don't switch away from the tools you love, and don't waste time switching back and forth. Use integrations to automatically update OKRs when your work gets done and foster ongoing feedback around your goals.

## How to enable integrations 

To enable integrations, navigate to **Admin > Integrations** and select **Enable** to activate a specific integration.

## How to view integrations 

When you are at the integrations page within the admin section, there are two views you can use to see all the different integrations we have: list view and grid view. 

The list view is a clean, compact view of all integrations with a clear call-to-action button to enable or manage the integration. 

The grid view is a detail-driven view that provides links to the corresponding help article and to contact support if necessary. 

You'll see the grid view by default. To toggle between the two views, select the icons in the upper-right corner of the page.

## How to create connections

To set up a connection, select **Enable** on the integration you want to set up a connection for, and follow the on-screen setup steps. 

**Remember that only admins can edit the connections others have created.** 

You make connections public (usable by everyone in the organization) or private by toggling the **Share connection** checkbox. Users will be able to see their private connections followed by public connections (if any).

## Data update frequency for integrations 

Viva Goals checks for new data about once per hour. 

You can also trigger a sync manually:

1. Select the integration icon next to the progress bar of an OKR or project.

2. Select the refresh symbol.

To do this, make sure the OKR or project is already integrated with one of the integration tools.

## How to edit an integration

There are three ways to edit an integration:

- Against a specific key result, go to **More Actions icon** > **Edit**. You'll find an option to **Edit** the integration under the **Connect data source to auto-update progress** dropdown. 

- For a simpler way to edit the integration, select the **Integrations icon** next to the progress bar and then select **Edit integration** from the pop-over window. 

- From the quick-view window, select the **Integrations icon**  and then select **Edit integration**.

## How to disable an integration

To disable an integration, select **Manage**, then select **Disable integration** from the **Change** dropdown. 

> [!NOTE]
> OKRs currently using the connection will no longer be able to sync.
