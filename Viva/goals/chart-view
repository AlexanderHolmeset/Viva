The chart view in Viva Goals displays all the OKRs and projects in a nested tree-like structure, providing a clear picture of the parent-child hierarchy. This view makes it easy to visually grasp the hierarchical structure of the OKRs and their status in a snapshot.

The Chart view is extremely helpful during big meetings such as Town Halls where you would be required to quickly present the OKRs & projects along with their alignment and an overview of their progress. 

## How to use the Chart view 

To switch to chart view from the default view: 

1. Select the ‘View chart’ button on the OKRs page under the ‘View options’ dropdown.

5. Click on the ‘Back’ button to return to the previous nesting level. 

6. Select the close button ‘x’ to exit the chart view.
