Viva Goals' KPI Summary  allows users to view one, or many, KPIs in a single view.

If your organization has the KPI Summary enabled, it will be found on all dashboards in Viva Goals and can be configured differently for each entity or team.

## KPI Summary

The KPI Summary will contain all top level objectives that are set as KPIs for that entity. It will display the alignment (if it exists), the current status given at last check-in, and the current value. It will also show the amount increased from the start value in small grey text.

## Who can Manage These Summaries?

The KPI summary can be managed by anyone who has admin permissions for the view.

A Viva Goals admin or Organization owner can manage the Organization level summary.

Team owner or team admin can manage their team's KPI summary.

Individual contributors can manage their KPI summary for Objectives they own.

## Add more KPIs Summary

If an objective has key results below it, or there are other key results, set as KPIs, users can manually add those to the KPI summary with the action button.

There's no limit on the number of KPIs you can include, however, we suggest that only the business's most critical KPIs be included to maintain an easy to understand view.

## Remove KPI Summary
  
To remove a KPI from the summary, click **Remove from KPI Summary** from the action dropdown.
