Viva Goals' KPI Summary allows users to view one or many KPIs in a single view.

If your organization has the KPI Summary enabled, it will be found on all dashboards in Viva Goals and can be configured differently for each team.

## KPI Summary

The KPI Summary contains all top-level objectives that are set as KPIs. It will display the alignment (if it exists), the current status given at last check-in, and the current value. It will also show the amount increased from the start value in small gray text.

## Who can manage KPI Summaries? 

The KPI Summary can be managed by anyone who has administrator permissions for the view.

A Viva Goals administrator or organization owner can manage the organization-level Summary.

A team owner or team administrator can manage their team's KPI Summary.

Individual contributors can manage their KPI Summary for objectives they own.

## How to add more KPIs to your KPI Summary

If an objective has key results below it, or there are other key results set as KPIs, users can manually add those to the KPI Summary with the action button.

There is no limit on the number of KPIs you can include, but we suggest that only your business's most critical KPIs be included to ensure a digestable view.

## How to remove a KPI from your KPI Summary
  
To remove a KPI from the KPI Summary, click **Remove from KPI Summary** from the action dropdown.

## How to rearrange KPIs in your KPI Summary
