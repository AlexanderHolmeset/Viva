# Close and score OKRs

It's been a few months since your ambitious brainstorming session to set your quarterly goals, and week after week you've stayed diligent with your check-ins. But now the quarter comes to a close and you get to find out:

How close did I come to actually achieving the goals that I set?

Let's find out.

### Closing out your OKRs

Closing an OKR in Viva Goals marks the beginning of the process of reflecting on how well an Objective or Key Result was accomplished. Scores in Viva Goals equal the numeric value assigned to this assessment. It's typically based on the progress of the success metric or progress of the key results. Users can also take into account other things (unexpected challenges, for example) and choose a different score.

**Timing**: The ideal time to score and close your OKRs is the final two weeks of the quarter, or if necessary, within the first few days of a new quarter.

In order to score your OKRs for your time period, you first have to begin the process of closing them. 

At Viva Goals, we recommend closing all KRs that roll up to an Objective, before closing the Objective. To begin the closing process for your OKRs:

1. Navigate to the Key Result you would like to close.

2. Select the **More Actions** drop down.

3. Select **Close**.

After selecting Close, a side panel will appear where you can begin the scoring process for your OKR.

Towards the end of each time period, you can save yourself from the hassle of closing your OKRs one by one, and close them all in one go. Here's how you can easily close and reflect on your OKRs: 

- Navigate to your OKR page. 

- Right above all your OKRs, select the **Close Objectives button**. This will open the quick view window. 

- Start reflecting on your OKRs, and assign a score to the objective if you're closing them. In case you're postponing the OKRs, determine what needs to be cloned, how the progress needs to be cloned while rolling over the unfinished objective. 

- At the bottom of the quick view window, you'll find a checkbox that's ticked to enable the chain check-in experience of all your objectives. Here, you'll find a summary of how many objectives have been closed, or postponed, and how many are yet to be reflected upon. 

- You can continue closing, or postponing each objective as you see fit, until you reach the last objective.

### Scoring OKRs

Scores in Viva Goals reflect how well an Objective or Key Result was accomplished on a scale of 0-1. It's typically based on the progress of the success metric or key results, but users can also take into account other qualitative factors and manually override the suggested score. At the end of the relevant time-period, a score in the range of 0.6 - 0.8 is a healthy place to be. 

Scores aren't meant to be a performance review, they typically signal whether the right Objectives were chosen. If an Objective gets consistently low scores, consider re-evaluating its relevance. On the flip side, if you consistently score high, try challenging yourself with more ambitious goals! 

Once you've begun the closing process, you'll then be able to assign a score to your objective.

The following fields are displayed:

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Metric***    |    This is the degree of completion that has been achieved for your OKR and may be represented by a KPI or a percent complete. In this field you'll enter your final number.     |
|**Overall Status**    |    By default, Viva Goals will set your status to closed. In order to successfully close the OKR, this status will need to remain closed.     |
|**Score**  |    Based on the above inputs, Viva Goals will recommend a score for your OKR, which is a simple calculation of your completed percentage mapped to a score between 0 and 1. You can choose to go with Viva Goals recommended score, or override it with a number of your preference based on the perceived outcome.     |
|**Continue working on this in another time period?**  |   This is a field where you can decide whether or not you want to move this objective to another time period in order to keep working on it. This will essentially postpone the completion of this OKR until the next quarter. Select Yes or No based on preference.    |
|**Closing Note**  |   This is a note about the OKRs you're closing. At Viva Goals, we recommend putting your final assessment of the success/failure of the OKR here and any suggestions you might have for including it in future time periods. |  

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-scoring-OKRs.png" alt-text="Image of scoring OKRs":::

Once all of the fields have been filled out, selecting **Close** will save the update, and the OKR dashboard will update to show your final status, a greyed out OKR, and a number at the end of the row. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-scoring-final-status.png" alt-text="Image of score final status":::

Now wait a minute: you might be wondering why a score of 1.0 is orange? After all, you completed 100% of the objective! Well, remember that the ideal OKR should be challenging but attainable. A score of 1.0 may indicate a need for more ambitious objectives. 

Added bonus: Users who are on our Enterprise plan can now override the default ranges for the color schemes we've provided for the OKRs. Here the org admin can configure the scoring ranges against which the color schemes will be mapped

Objectives in Viva Goals get scored automatically once all the Key Results under them are scored. The score allocated is obtained by averaging the percentage completion rates of its associated Key Results. However, sometimes the sum is greater (or lesser!) than the parts. Feel free to change the calculated score.

#### Why modify the score? An example.

When you score and close your OKRs, Viva Goals automatically generates a score for you. So let's say your Objective was "Secure the next round of funding for my startup" and your KR was "Meet with 10 potential investors for coffee this month."

Standard scoring would look like this:

- If you met with 8 investors this month, your score would be .8

- If you met with only 2 investors this month, your score would be .2

**Seems pretty straightforward, right? Why would you need to modify things?**

- Well, if you met with 8 investors, and 2 of them ended the meeting early, 4 of them turned you down, and 2 of them not only turned you down, but said that your company idea was stupid and would never work, then you might downgrade your score from a "successful" .8 to a more realistic .3. Yes, you did well with going on meetings, but you were far away from getting funding.

- On the other hand, if you met with only 2 investors, and one of them thought your idea was amazing but passed, and the second one agreed to give you $1 million in funding, you could certainly upgrade your score from a "failed" .2 to a "mission accomplished": 1.0. 

## Scoring Guidance

Viva Goals Scoring Guidance feature allows users to add guidance for others to see how progress should be tracked and/or how a score should be calculated.

If your organization has Scoring Guidance enabled, users will be able to define how they're tracking progress of an Objective and how to score it at the end of the time period. 

This promotes further transparency and understanding throughout your organization and the progress of your OKRs. 

## Add Scoring Guidance

Scoring Guidance can be added to a new or existing Objective when adding or editing takes place. Simply select **Add scoring guidance**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-add-scoring-guidance.png" alt-text="Image of adding Scoring Guidance":::

Then type out your objectives guide for progress and scoring. As illustrated below, you can see that we've identified the milestones included in shipping a new feature and their corresponding percentages of completion.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-objectives-guide-progress-and-scoring.png" alt-text="Image of objectives guide for progress and scoring ":::

Once you have set scoring guidance for an Objective, you can view it by selecting the information icon next to the name or the time period. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-information-icon.png" alt-text="Image of information icon":::

It's also available in the Objective detail view.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-objective-detail-view.png" alt-text="Image of the Objective detail view":::

When making Check-ins the Scoring Guidance will be displayed for user reference.

If you have an enterprise subscription and would like to have this enabled for your organization, please have an admin account and reach out to support@xxxxx.com with the request. 

### Some best practices to remember while scoring key results

- Keep the evaluation simple. If your Objective is to increase traffic to your website by 20%, and you increased it by 15%, give yourself a 0.75.

- Scores don't equate to your performance. Scores indicate whether the right Objectives were picked or not - they help improve the process. If an Objective is consistently scoring low, maybe it’s not important enough for the team. Contemplate if it is still worth pursuing.

- If you're scoring a lot of 1’s, evaluate your Objectives. Are they too easy or too safe? Your goals must make you slightly uncomfortable. 0.7 is a good score!

## Best practices for closing out an OKR period

### Assess how things went

Score and close key results of your Objectives using the **Close** action. When all key results of an Objective are closed, Viva Goals will automatically assign a score for the Objective based on the score of the Key Results. You can learn more about [scoring and closing OKRs](scoring-and-closing-OKRs.md). 

### Self reflection 

Once the Objectives are scored, step back and think about how the quarter went overall. 

- Which Objectives did I complete successfully? What are the key reasons for succeeding in those?

- Which Objectives did I struggle to do? What issues did I run into?

- What lessons have I learned this period that I can apply to how to structure my OKRs in the next period?

### Review with your manager and/or team

- If you're an individual contributor, review your assessment and share your observations with your manager and get their feedback. 

- If you're a team manager, have 1:1 discussions with each of your team members to review their OKRs and provide your feedback. Close out all team OKRs and review the assessment on the team OKRs with all of your team members. Share your notes on why the team OKRs were given the scores and invite them to provide feedback; and invite team members to share their reflections including what lessons from this period can be applied to next period's OKRs.

### Rollover unfinished objectives

Sometimes Objectives don't get completed, and that’s okay. Evaluate the Objective to see whether it's still relevant and attainable. If it is, here's how you can easily [rollover the Objective](cloning-objectives.md) to the next time period. 

### Postpone objectives 

Sometimes, due to unforeseen circumstances, a business may need to pivot and reprioritize goals for the quarter. With Viva Goals users have the ability to postpone their Objectives and de-prioritize them for the current time period, while allowing them to remain visible for later on.

When a stipulated time period ends (basically, the end of a quarter, or end of a year), and you haven't made the desired progress on your objectives, you can either close them or postpone them to the consequent time period. If you choose to postpone, the chosen objective, its immediate key results and associated projects (if projects has been enabled for your organization; if not, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to get this turned on) will be cloned to the following time period.

Say, you have an objective to increase brand awareness with a key result to drive more traffic to your website by publishing 10 blogs, and owing to various reasons, you're unable to accomplish this. After the quarter has ended, you can choose to either close this objective and start afresh for the next quarter, or you can postpone this to the next quarter to resume work on this, and accomplish your target. This objective, its key results, and projects will be cloned to the next quarter if you choose to postpone it.

#### Why postpone

Typically, an Objective or a Key Result will need to be postponed when there are shifting priorities. For example, if an organization is shifting focus from manufacturing a product, to producing updated parts, an OKR around "completed products" may begin to drag down the overall score as the focus shifts. In this instance, users may decide to push these OKRs to get completed during a different quarter. 

When you postpone an objective, it closes it out – similar to if you were to mark it "Closed," but the percent completed is no longer counted towards the overall goal of the quarter. If business needs change again, you can reopen and begin recounting it towards the overall goal.

#### How to postpone OKRs?

1. Navigate to the objective you want to postpone.

2. Select the **check-in** symbol towards the right of the progress bar. If the current progress is 0, the status will be **Postpone** by default. Anything other than a 0, the status will be **Closed** by default.

3. You'll have an option to **Continue working on this in another time period**. Choose **Yes**.

4. The chosen objective, its key results, and projects will be postponed to the next quarter, which implies that it will be cloned automatically to the next quarter.

5. Provide the **closing note**, and select **Close** to close this objective, and continue working on it in the next quarter.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-how-to-postpone.gif" alt-text="Image of How to postpone":::
    - If you want to postpone it, select the **More actions** symbol. You'll be able to find the option to postpone.
    
    - Provide a **reason for postponing**, and select  **Postpone** to finish the process.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-reason-for-postponing.gif" alt-text="Image of Provide a reason for postponing":::

#### Close or postpone?

***When the progress is 0***

If the current progress is 0, the status will be **Postponed** by default. A progress of 0 potentially means you haven't started working on the objective, or the work you've done hasn't moved the needle on the objective.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-postpone-progress-0.gif" alt-text="Image of When the progress is 0":::

***When the progress is anything but 0***

If the current progress is anything greater than 0, the status will be **Closed** by default. This is owing to the fact that there's a substantial amount of progress made, and you might want to close the objective with the progress you're it at that given point in time. However, you also have the option to postpone this objective to chart progress toward the desired goal.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-postpone-anything-but-0.gif" alt-text="Image of When the progress is anything but 0":::

#### Progress updates when an objective is postponed

As you know, there are two methods of measuring progress in Viva Goals, namely **Percent completed**, and **KPI (success metric)**. The progress will be reset by default when it is postponed to the following time period. You can choose to preserve the progress as well.

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-postpone-objective.png" alt-text="Image of What happens to my progress when I postpone the objective":::

The word 'reset' has a different meaning in the context of Percent completed and KPI.

***Percent completed***

The progress when reset to 0 and the objective is postponed to the next time period, you'll start working on it from the ground up in terms of the progress.

***KPI***

The progress will be reset to the current value. For instance, you want to publish 10 blogs, and you've published five blogs this quarter. When you postpone this to the next quarter, your starting value will be 5, and not 0.
