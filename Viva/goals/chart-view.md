Viva Goals’ Chart View feature is a powerful tool that provides an easy-to-consume visualization of objectives and the alignment between them. The Chart View lets you see how different teams and the organization’s Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are structured in a glance:

A stacked card indicates that the objective has key results - you can select a stacked card to see the key results and navigate further down the hierarchy. Watch organization-level key results turn into department-level objectives, while department-level key results cascade into team-level objectives and so on.
