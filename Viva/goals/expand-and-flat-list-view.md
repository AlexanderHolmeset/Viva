## Expand View

The Expand view is a time saving view option under the list view which when enabled expands all the top-level objectives listed in the OKRs page, at once, to display one level of children. 

To enable/disable the expand view: 

1. Click on the ‘View options’ dropdown on the OKRs page.

## Flat-list View 

As the name suggests, the flat-list view, another view option under the list view, removes the hierarchical structure found in the default view in the OKRs page and displays them all as a flat list. That is, in this view, the parent and child OKRs are all on the same level and are listed one after another without any nesting. 

To enable/disable the flat-list view: 

1. Click on the ‘View options’ dropdown on the OKRs page.

2. Now, click on the ‘Show flat-list view’ toggle button to enable it. If the toggle is blue, flat-list view is enabled.

3. To disable this view, click on the ‘Show flat-list view’ toggle button again. By default, it is disabled.
