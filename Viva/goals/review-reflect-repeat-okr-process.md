Now that the quarter is over and you've closed and scored your OKRs, you can take the final step in the process, which could be called "the three Rs."

## Review your progress

First, review your progress. 

- **Timing**: Assuming that you've scored and closed your OKRs, the ideal time to review and reflect on progress is the final two weeks of the quarter.

- Managers and individual employees should meet to discuss why certain goals were or weren't met. 

- Further, teams and individuals across the organization should communicate with each other to identify dependencies and areas for improvement.

- Survey employees to get feedback on the process and drive improvement.

- Pull reports for which employees and groups are participating or not.

- Communicate progress back up to senior management, and even share wins at an all-company meeting or on Slack. 

## Reflect and adjust

During your review, you should take a moment to reflect and ask yourself some of these questions:

- What Objectives did I complete successfully, and why?

- What issues did my team or I struggle with?

- What lessons were learned that can be applied to the next period?

- What do we want to start doing, stop doing, or continue doing in the next period?

- What OKRs can be rewritten to be more effective in the next quarter?

- What technology integrations can be added to streamline our process?

- What reports and dashboards can be created to easily track progress?

- What additional training is needed for leaders and employees?

## Repeat your process

With a successful quarter in the books, open lines of communication, and a thoughtful reflection on success (or improvements), you're ready to repeat your process and take on the next quarter:

- **Timing**: It is best practice to draft and finalize your OKRs no later than the first week to 10 days into the next quarter. Otherwise, you run the risk of your goal setting process dragging several weeks into the next quarter.

- Clone OKRs that didn't get fully completed in the previous quarter over to the next quarter, adjusting goals as necessary (see resources).

- Draft and finalize new OKRs, iterating and scaling past results to create new stretch goals.

- Communicate changes to your team and other departments.

- Expand the number of people in your organization using Viva Goals to foster alignment and transparency across your company.

- Remember that this takes time and might take several quarters for everyone to be on board and seeing results.
