It's been a few months since your ambitious brainstorming session to set your quarterly goals, and week after week you've stayed diligent with your check-ins. But now the quarter comes to a close and you get to find out:

How close did I come to actually achieving the goals that I set?

Let's find out.

## Closing out your OKRs

**Timing**: The ideal time to score and close your OKRs is the final two weeks of the quarter, or if necessary, within the first few days of a new quarter.

1. Select the first Key Result you wish to score.

2. Select the **Close** option from the action menu or select **Close during a check-in**.

3. Enter the final value for your Key Result; this could be a percentage (that is, 80% complete) or a metric (that is, $50,000 in sales).

    Viva Goals will automatically assign you a score between 0 and 1 based on your result, such as a 0.8 for the Key Result that was 80% complete.

    You have the option to modify the assigned score if you like (see below).

6. Add a closing note to provide any context to your scoring.

7. Repeat for each Key Result you're responsible for.

    Viva Goals will roll up the results into an overall color-coded score.
