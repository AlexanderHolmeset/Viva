## What is a named range?

You can name ranges in Excel(.xlsx) or Google Sheets to keep better track of them and create cleaner formulas. Instead of using a column and row number to describe a range of cells, you could give the cell a unique range name that can be referred to at any point in time.

## What are the benefits of using named ranges?

Naming ranges in Excel or Google sheets can help you bring a lot of flexibility into your workbooks.

Name ranges have an explicit name that makes it simpler for you or any user to refer to the contents in a cell. With a unique name, you can mitigate the confusion that comes with using row and column numbers and it becomes much easier for you or for anyone who needs to work with your workbook or sheet.

Also, name ranges are permanent so if you make any changes in your sheet by adding or deleting rows and columns, the cell you refer to by a named range will always be permanent while this is not the case when you use row and column numbers.

## How to create a named range in excel?

1. Select the range for which you want to create a Named Range in Excel.

2. Select Define Name under Formulas

3. In the New Name dialogue box, type the Name you wish to assign to the selected data range. You can specify the scope as the entire workbook or a specific worksheet. If you select a particular sheet, the name would not be available on other sheets.

4. Click OK

## How to create a named range in Google sheets?

1. Open a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

2. Select the cells you want to name.

3. Click on Named ranges under Data. A menu will open on the right.

4. Type the range name you want.

5. Click Done.
