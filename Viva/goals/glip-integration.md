## Introduction to Glip integration

RingCentral Glip is a collaboration software that enables teams to seamlessly collaborate over projects with the ability to message, initiate a voice or video chat, transfer files, and manage tasks within the workspace. Viva Goals' Glip integration is a quintessential collaboration integration that gives greater context to everyday work by bringing objectives in Viva Goals and conversations in Glip together. This integration will provide you with the summarized Objectives and Key Results (OKR) progress and status updates for the company, teams or individuals delivered to Glip conversations.

For example, if you have the Sales team spread across three regions: US, Europe, and Asia. You have a primary channel named **Org-Sales** for the Sales team in Glip, and specific objectives for each regional team in Viva Goals. By integrating Glip with Viva Goals, you'll be able to receive the updates on the objectives of the US, Europe, and Asia teams in the **Org-Sales** channel without leaving Glip. As and when members of the regional teams make check-ins on their OKRs, you'll be able to monitor the updates in the context of your Glip conversations.

## How to enable the Glip Integration?

Admins can perform the following steps to enable this integration:

- From the sidebar, go to **Admin** and select the **Integrations** tab.

## Get started

There are two steps to be followed to get up and running with the Glip integration:

- Map Glip teams to the desired entity in Viva Goals (the company, teams, and/or users).

- Customize the cadence and frequency at which the updates should be posted to Glip conversations.

## Map Glip teams to an entity in Viva Goals

- You can map the **Glip conversations** to the OKRs of the company, team, or an individual in Viva Goals. Navigate to the **respective OKR page**, and select the **Followers** button.

- Go to the **Glip teams** tab, and select **Add Followers** to start adding the **Glip conversations** as followers to the chosen entity. This implies that the added Glip conversations will receive the summarized OKR progress and status updates of the chosen entity, which could be the company, team, or user.

## Customize the cadence and frequency

- You can determine the **frequency and the cadence** for when the updates will be posted in Glip. Select the gear icon next to the **Follow** link from the title pane of the dashboard to open the popup. You can also select the **Change update time** in the alert that shows after you follow the company, team or individual.

- There are two schedules: default and custom. The default schedule will send updates **every week on Mondays at 09:00 AM (recipient's time zone)**.

- If you want this customized, select **Custom schedule** and choose the frequency — weekly or monthly, and the cadence — day and the time, that you would like the Glip conversations to receive the update.

- Select **Done** to save your settings.
