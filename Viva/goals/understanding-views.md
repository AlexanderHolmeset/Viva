# Understand Views in Viva Goals

When you log in to your Viva Goals account, you will be able to view and access all your OKR-related information on your OKRs page. With different views, you can access your OKRs for different purposes and in different ways.

## Which views are available in Viva Goals? 

There are three views that are available in Viva Goals: 

- **List view** - The list view is the default view in Viva goals. This view enables creating, reviewing, and tracking progress for OKRs and projects across one or more time periods with information like title, type, owner, time period, status, progress, and alignment.

- **Quick View** - Quick view is a panel that appears on the right side of the OKRs page when you select the title of an OKR or a project. This view provides an overview of progress, details, alignment, children objectives, and activity for an OKR or a Project.

- **Chart view** - The chart view in Viva Goals displays all the OKRs and projects in a nested tree-like structure, providing a clear picture of the parent-child hierarchy. This view makes it easy to visually grasp the hierarchical structure of the OKRs and their status in a snapshot. 

## List view 

The OKRs and projects in the list view are listed in a hierarchical tree structure with the ability to expand or collapse. When you expand an objective, you will be able to view all the key results, child objectives, and projects under that objective. 

Child objectives and key results in certain cases can be further expanded to see the OKRs and projects that are cascaded under them.

You can also view the parent objective that a particular objective is aligned to. 

### Understanding list view hierarchy

**There are three levels of hierarchy in an organization:**

- Organization OKRs & projects 

- Team-level OKRs & projects 

- Individual OKRs & projects  

**The typical hierarchical structure in Viva Goals is:**

### Available actions in list view 

- **Time periods** - Time periods are the OKR operating periods or cycles. Every OKR or Project is always tagged to a particular time period and has a start & end date. Time periods are key to help you navigate and find OKRs and Projects for an organization, team or a user.

- **Summary panel** - View the progress and status of all your OKRs in that time period, along with the expected vs. actual progress comparison.

- **3KPIs panel** - You can view the KPIs that are used to track your OKRs in this section. 

- **Add objective** - Create an objective of the type of organization/team/individual.

-  **Drag and drop** - Reprioritize and change the order of OKRs and projects in the list view.

- **Multi-select** - Use the checkbox on the list view row to select more than one OKR or a Project to perform bulk edit, move, and clone actions.

- **View options** - From this drop-down, you can select to show more information, expand all OKRs by default, show OKRs in a flat view, and compare to a time period. The expand view is a time-saving view option under the list view. When enabled, all the top-level objectives listed in the OKRs page, at once, to display one level of children. The flat-list view, another view option under the list view, removes the hierarchical structure found in the default view in the OKRs page and displays them all as a flat list. That is, in this view, the parent and child OKRs are all on the same level and are listed one after another without any nesting. 

- **Bulk Check-in** - Make check-ins on multiple OKRs that were not updated since the last check-in reminder in a guided workflow.

- **Group By** - The grouping option lets you streamline your OKR and Project view even further. You can group your OKR or Project list in the following categories:

    - Time period
    - Entity
    - Owner
    - Status

### OKR or project actions within list view

1. Select the (`>`) expand icon next to  an objective to view all the key results, child objectives, and projects under it.  

2. Select the objective to open the quick view and make updates to that objective.  

3. Select the check-in icon or select the progress bar for an OKR/project to initiate and make a check-in. Learn more about check-ins.

4. Add a key result or a project under an objective from the (`...`) more options menu on the row.

5. As an OKR owner, make edits to an OKR or a project inline by clicking on the edit icon next to the title, owner, type and time period information in the list.

6. Select the more options (`...`) icon on the list-view row to perform additional actions like close, postpone, edit alignment and more on an OKR or a project.

## Quick view 

When you open the quick view, you'll see it has five tabs:

- Overview

- Key Results

- Projects

- Child Objectives

- Activity

Let's look at the content of each of these tabs. 

### Overview tab 

The Overview tab gives you a quick snapshot of the most important information about OKRs. This includes:

- **OKR Progress** - The progress you have made on the current objective, expected progress, and your OKR's progress status. You can make progress updates in two ways: dragging the progress scroll bar to input your updates or clicking the ‘check-in’ button and entering your progress. 

- **Manage Contributions** - Control how much contribution each child makes to the progress of the current objective. 

- **Last Check-in Note** - Shows you the most recent check-in on an OKR so you can extra context to your Progress chart. If you don't see any check-in notes, it might be a good idea to add one.

- **Owner** - Shows the owner of the objective.

- **Type** - Shows whether an OKR is for an organization, team or individual. You can change the type in this tab.

- **Time period** - Displays the time period that the current objective belongs to. 

- **Last Updated** - Shows when the current objective was last updated.

- **Add a description** - Allows you to add a quick blurb on what the objective is about to provide others with more context.

- **Alignment** - This shows you how the current objective or project is aligned to its parent. For example, if you are viewing an objective's quick view, you will see how it is aligned to a parent objective, if any. To edit alignment, select the ‘Edit’ button.

### Key Results

The Key Results section of the quick view shows you all the key results that have been created for the current objective. You will also see how much progress was made towards these key results, which team owns it, and the owner of the key result. If you haven't created any key results, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

### Projects

Similar to the Key Results section, the Projects section shows you all the projects that ladder up to the current objective. You will also see how much progress has been made on the project. If you haven't created any projects, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

### Child Objectives

All objectives can have a child objective aligned to them. You can view and navigate to the child objective from this section. If you haven't created any child objective, you can use the **Add** button to create one.

### Activity

In the Activity section, you can catch up quickly on everything that has happened leading to the current status of the OKR.

If you want to view all the information pertaining to an OKR and a project, including progress, details, alignment, children and activity, you can access this from a full page detailed view. You can get to the detail view by clicking on the link to "open in full view" from the list/ quick view or from an objective link inside a notification.

## Chart View 

The Viva Goals Chart View feature is a powerful tool that provides an easy-to-consume visualization of objectives and the alignment between them. The Chart View lets you see how different teams and the organization’s Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are structured in a glance.

A stacked card indicates that the objective has key results—you can select a stacked card to see the key results and navigate further down the hierarchy. Watch organization-level key results turn into department-level objectives, while department-level key results cascade into team-level objectives and so on.

To view the objective in more detail, select the **See Details** option.

To enable chart view for the organization’s OKRs or for a team or an individual, select the **View chart** option from the **View Options** drop-down:
