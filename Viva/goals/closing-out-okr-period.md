# Closing out OKR period

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Goals is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change. [Learn more about Viva Goals.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189933)


## Assess how things went

Score and close key results of your Objectives using the **Close** action. When all key results of an Objective are closed, Viva Goals will automatically assign a score for the Objective based on the score of the Key Results. You can learn more about [scoring and closing OKRs](scoring-and-closing-OKRs.md). 

## Self reflection 

Once the Objectives are scored, step back and think about how the quarter went overall. 

- Which Objectives did I complete successfully? What are the key reasons for succeeding in those?

- Which Objectives did I struggle to do? What issues did I run into?

- What lessons have I learned this period that I can apply to how to structure my OKRs in the next period?

## Review with your manager and/or team

- If you're an individual contributor, review your assessment and share your observations with your manager and get their feedback. 

- If you're a team manager, have 1:1 discussions with each of your team members to review their OKRs and provide your feedback. Close out all team OKRs and review the assessment on the team OKRs with all of your team members. Share your notes on why the team OKRs were given the scores and invite them to provide feedback; and invite team members to share their reflections including what lessons from this period can be applied to next period's OKRs.

## Rollover unfinished objectives

Sometimes Objectives don't get completed, and thatâ€™s okay. Evaluate the Objective to see whether it's still relevant and attainable. If it is, here's how you can easily [rollover the Objective](cloning-objectives.md) to the next time period. 

### Postpone objectives 

When a stipulated time period ends (basically, the end of a quarter, or end of a year), and you haven't made the desired progress on your objectives, you can either close them or postpone them to the consequent time period. The chosen objective, its immediate key results and associated projects (if projects has been enabled for your organization; if not, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to get this turned on) will be cloned to the following time period.

Say, you have an objective to increase brand awareness with a key result to drive more traffic to your website by publishing 10 blogs, and owing to various reasons, you're unable to accomplish this. After the quarter has ended, you can choose to either close this objective and start afresh for the next quarter, or you can postpone this to the next quarter to resume work on this, and accomplish your target. This objective, its key results, and projects will be cloned to the next quarter if you choose to postpone it.

### Should I close or postpone?

***When the progress is 0***

If the current progress is 0, the status will be **Postponed** by default. A progress of 0 potentially means you haven't started working on the objective, or the work you've done hasn't moved the needle on the objective.

***When the progress is anything but 0***

If the current progress is anything greater than 0, the status will be **Closed** by default. This is owing to the fact that there's a substantial amount of progress made, and you might want to close the objective with the progress you're it at that given point in time. However, you also have the option to postpone this objective to chart progress toward the desired goal.

### What happens to my progress when I postpone the objective? 

As you know, there are two methods of measuring progress in Viva Goals, namely **Percent completed**, and **KPI (success metric)**. The progress will be reset by default when it is postponed to the following time period. You can choose to preserve the progress as well.

The word 'reset' has a different meaning in the context of Percent completed and KPI.

***Percent completed***

The progress when reset to 0 and the objective is postponed to the next time period, you'll start working on it from the ground up in terms of the progress.

***KPI***

The progress will be reset to the current value. For instance, you want to publish 10 blogs, and you've published five blogs this quarter. When you postpone this to the next quarter, your starting value will be 5, and not 0.

**How should I postpone?**

1. Navigate to the objective you want to postpone.

2. Select the **check-in** symbol towards the right of the progress bar. If the current progress is 0, the status will be **Postpone** by default. Anything other than a 0, the status will be **Closed** by default.

3. You'll have an option to **Continue working on this in another time period**. Choose **Yes**.

4. The chosen objective, its key results, and projects will be postponed to the next quarter, which implies that it will be cloned automatically to the next quarter.

5. Provide the **closing note**, and select **Close** to close this objective, and continue working on it in the next quarter.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/goals-how-to-postpone.gif" alt-text="Image of How to postpone":::
    - If you want to postpone it, select the **More actions** symbol. You'll be able to find the option to postpone.
    
    - Provide a **reason for postponing**, and select  **Postpone** to finish the process.
