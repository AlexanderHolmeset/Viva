# View & share feedback results as a feedback author

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

Feedback authors can view the feedback results from their team if they obtained the minimum number of responses needed to meet the confidentiality threshold.

## View feedback results as feedback author in Viva Pulse

1. From the Teams Activity Feed notification that the feedback request is closed, review the feedback report if you meet the minimum confidentiality threshold. If you did not meet the minimum confidentiality threshold, you will see your feedback report received insufficient responses. Alternatively, from the Viva Pulse homepage **My pulses** section, under the **Pulses sent** tab, you can review the feedback report by selecting the corresponding feedback request card.
2. The report summary page will have the following sections/actions:
    1. View how many users responded to the Pulse request, both as a percentage as well as a count.
    2. Select **View all** under **Who you invited** to view the list of feedback providers for the Pulse request.
    3. Choose to resend the Pulse request.
3. If you did not meet the minimum confidentiality threshold, you cannot view scores or responses for any questions. You can still view the number of feedback providers and be able to resend the Pulse request.
4. If you obtained the minimum number of responses to meet the confidentiality threshold, you can see the average scores for all rating questions, top suggestions for all multiple-choice questions, or number of responses received for any open-ended questions.
    1. For the average scores in rating questions, you can view how the score has changed from the last time the Pulse request was sent.
5. Select the comments link to open a dialog for all the open-ended responses. This applies to both multiple-choice questions as well as questions for open-ended responses.
6. Choose to share the Pulse requests with other users in your organization by selecting **Share results** either through using the button at the top or bottom of the reporting summary page.
7. You are also provided with guidance for how to facilitate a conversation with your team about the feedback results by accessing the Discuss option in the **Review discussion guide** section at the bottom of the report summary page.
8. For any rating question which has a follow-up multiple-choice question, you can select the question row and dive into a detailed page for that question:
    1. View how the score for that Pulse request has been trending over time.
    2. View how the score for a question has been trending over time by hovering over a specific point in the trend graph.
    <br><br> **Note:** To view trends for a question response, the same Pulse request must be resent. If the feedback author chooses to send a new Pulse request from the Viva Pulse homepage instead of resending the same Pulse request, the score trend view will not be generated. <br><br>
    3. View the favorability scores for the selected question.
        1. Responses with a score of 4 or 5 are considered positive responses.
        2. Responses with a score of 3 are considered neutral responses.
        3. Responses with a score of 1 or 2 are considered negative responses.
    4. View the corresponding multiple-choice responses for each follow-up question, by seeing which options were most selected by feedback providers, shown in decreasing order of popularity.
    5. View any open-ended responses that may have been provided as part of the follow-up multiple-choice question.
    6. View any recommended learning content for the selected question. The learning course will open in Viva Learning when selected.
    <br><br> **Note:** Recommended Viva Learning links will only show for reports generated after March 21, 2023.
