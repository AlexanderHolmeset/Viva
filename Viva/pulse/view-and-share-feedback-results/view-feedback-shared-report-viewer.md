Shared report viewers can view the teamâ€™s feedback results if the feedback author shared the results with them.

<!--Alternate version of line 28:

The feedback author must share the team's feedback results to create a shared report view. -->

## View feedback results with shared report viewer in Viva Pulse

Three methods exist to view the feedback report.
- From the **Teams Activity Feed notification** that the feedback report has been shared by the feedback author, select **Review results**. 
- From the Viva Pulse homepage > **My pulses** section > **Shared with me** tab > select the corresponding **feedback request card**.
- From the email or Teams message the feedback author provided, select the link.
 
 
## Summary report page content

On the report summary page, you can view the following information:
- Who shared the report with you
- How many users responded to the Pulse request, both as a percentage as well as a count
- The list of feedback providers for the Pulse request under **Who you invited** > **View all**
- The average score for each rating question, along with the trend change from the last time the Pulse request was sent
- Top suggestions for all multiple-choice questions
- The number of responses received for any questions with open-ended responses. You are unable to view any open-ended responses from feedback providers
- How the score has been trending over time for any rating question that has a follow-up multiple-choice question for that Pulse request by selecting the question row to see a page of details for that question. For trends, the feedback author **must resend the same Pulse request**. If the feedback author chooses to send a new Pulse request from the Viva Pulse homepage instead of resending the same Pulse request, the score trend view won't generate.  
- How the score for a question has been trending over time by hovering over a specific point in the trend graph. For trends, the feedback author **must resend the same Pulse request**. If the feedback author chooses to send a new Pulse request from the Viva Pulse homepage instead of resending the same Pulse request, the score trend view won't generate.
