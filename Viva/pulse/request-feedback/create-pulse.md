Feedback authors with Viva Pulse licenses can request pulses from their teams by using research-backed templates.

1. From the Viva Pulse homepage, select one of the research-backed templates in the **Get started by asking for feedback on…** section to request feedback from your team. Alternatively , from the Viva Pulse homepage, you can select **Send a pulse** in the **Welcome** section or navigate to the **My pulses** section, under the **Pulses sent tab**, select **Start a new pulse** to request feedback from your team.
2. Preview the questions in the template you selected and review the types of questions that are asked: rating, multiple choice, and open-ended.
3. If customization is enabled for your organization, you can add your own questions to the end of any of the templates and update the template name to personalize the Pulse request to your team’s needs:
    1. Choose from rating, multiple choice, or open-ended questions.
    2. Click the pencil icon next to the template name to update the title of your Pulse request.
    <br><br> **Note:** A customized Pulse can include up to 25 questions in total.<br><br>

5. Add a personal note  if applicable and then select **Send request**.
6. Sending the request will trigger a Teams Activity Feed notification to the selected feedback providers for them to provide their feedback.
7. Select **Copy link** to copy a link to your Pulse request that you can share with the selected feedback providers in a personal email or Teams message after you send your request, or later from the homepage.
8. If you have not obtained enough responses to meet the minimum confidentiality threshold needed to review the feedback results 3 days prior to the Pulse request deadline, you will receive a Teams Activity Feed notification to either extend the deadline or add feedback providers.
