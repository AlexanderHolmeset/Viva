# Admin management of the General Settings feature in Viva Glint 

Details defining your Viva Glint programs are set up and viewed by selecting the configuration symbol on your Microsoft Viva Glint admin dashboard and then General Settings in the Client Settings section.  

Once you have designated your General Settings, they are valid for all your Viva Glint programs until you edit them. 

## Standard procedures for General Settings section setup 

For each setting option, you'll see a short description so you can feel confident about the choices you make. There are seven sections which require input: 

- Company information 
- Communications 
- Reporting 
- Engage Survey Details 
- Features 
- Technical Configuration 
- Translations 

>[!NOTE]
> Any changes you make in the General Settings will apply to all survey programs created in Viva Glint.

## Set up the Company Information section 

This section provides high-level information about your company. Provide your:

|**Field**| **Definition and notes**|
|-----------|-----------|
|**Client UUID**   | How Viva Glint identifies your company in our system  |  
|**Client Name**    | *Or Doing Business As (DBA) name*   | 
|**Client Time Zone**    | Survey and reminder emails will be sent out in this time zone unless **Send surveys in usersâ€™ time zones is checked**.    | 
|**SharePoint Site Name**    | Data files can be dropped here or on the Viva Glint SFTP site.    | 
|**Top-Level Manager**    | This employee is used to build managerial hierarchy and is the only person in your organization that does not report to anyone at a higher level.|
