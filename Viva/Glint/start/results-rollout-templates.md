# Communicate results rollout plans for Viva Glint programs using email templates  

Communicating survey expectations and results is an essential part of a strong engagement program strategy. 

Use the results rollout templates below to customize and send to the people in your organization to prepare them to act on feedback from your Viva Glint programs. The templates are for guidance only and assume a six-week launch, which may be longer than your timeline. Align your communications as appropriate.  

Sample communications aren't generated in the Viva Glint platform. 

The following are hyperlinks to email templates that Microsoft Viva Glint recommends sending to your people post-survey close. 

## Tips for using Viva Glint templates 

- Customize the content in your voice. Look for placeholders, like [company name], and insert applicable information. 
- Adapt messages based on your organization’s familiarity with the feedback and reporting process.  
- Condense the communication cascade as much as possible. Be cautious of information overload.  
- Consider the timing of other company-wide initiatives and communication plans. Look for opportunities to align communication and streamline employee touch points.
