# Connection: Viva Engage and Viva Connections

Viva Engage and Viva Connections work together to surface relevant content and to empower employees to contribute, collaborate, work, and share. For example, one way an employee can discover a meaningful conversation is seeing a conversation meaningful to them when it is surfaced in the feed of Viva Connections.

Viva Connections operates at a Viva-wide scope, bringing together content, tasks and resources in a tailored, structured and curated experience reflecting the priorities of the organization and the user's job role. It provides a one-stop shop, a "home" for the employee experience.

Viva Engage is all about employees, leaders, coworkers and communities. Viva Engage powers the social layer of Microsoft Viva and Microsoft 365. It features experiences for discovery of conversations happening across the organization, for asking questions and sharing knowledge, for deeper engagement, for virtual events, and for building social capital and extending your network at work.

Used together, the Viva Connections feed features relevant content from Viva Engage, including announcements, mentions (@ mentions), and storyline posts from people you follow. The Viva Connections feed includes content from other sources as well, including SharePoint news.


## Viva Connections

* A branded app experience in Microsoft Teams that is optimized to enable experiences for information workers and frontline workers.
