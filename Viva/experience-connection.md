## Viva Connections and Viva Engage together

Viva Engage and Viva Connections work together to surface relevant content and to empower employees to contribute, collaborate, work, and share.

Viva Connections operates at a Viva-wide scope, bringing together content, tasks and resources in a tailored, structured and curated experience reflecting the priorities of the organization and the user's job role. It provides a one-stop shop, a "home" for the employee experience. 

Viva Engage is all about you, leaders, coworkers and communities.

Viva Engage powers the social layer of Microsoft Viva and Microsoft 365. The app is a place to connect and engage with leaders, colleagues, and communities. It features experiences for discovery of conversations happening across the organization, for asking questions and sharing knowledge, for deeper engagement, for virtual events, and for building social capital and extending your network at work.

The Viva Connections feed features relevant content from Viva Engage, including announcements, mentions (@ mentions), and storyline posts from people you follow. The Viva Connections feed includes content from other sources as well, including SharePoint news.
