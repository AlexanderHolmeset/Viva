# Viva admin experience
With the new Microsoft Viva admin experience, admins can initiate setup, deployment, and license management for all generally available Viva applications from a central location in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.â€¯

> [!NOTE]
> This article is intended for [Targeted Release](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365) customers. Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have set up the targeted release options in Microsoft 365. If you're not part of the targeted release program, you may not yet see this feature or it may look different than what is described in this help article. Features are subject to change. If you are not in the Targeted Release program, see [Set up Microsoft Viva](/viva/setup-microsoft-viva.md).

## Getting to the admin experience

1. Sign into your account as an Microsoft 365 admin.
2. In the Microsoft 365 admin center (MAC) search for Microsoft Viva.
3. In the search results, select Microsoft Viva. This brings you to the [Microsoft Viva admin page](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/featureexplorer/collections/VivaExperiences).

Things you can do on this page:

- You can select **Manage licenses** or **Manage roles** to go directly to the Microsoft 365 Licenses page or to the Microsoft 365 Role assignments page. On the Role assignments page, you can search for Viva in the search box to narrow the licenses or roles to those specific to Viva.
- You can see the type of Viva plan purchased or included with Microsoft 365 in the **Plan type** column.
- You can see quickly whether admin roles have been assigned for each app, and who the roles are assigned to in the **Admins** column. Hover over the profile circles to get the names of people who are assigned roles
- You can select an app to go to that app's settings page.
- Manage briefing email in Viva

## App settings pages
Each app has its own settings page. Here's an example of the Learning admin page:
