# Communicate pre-launch and live Viva Glint program information using email templates

Communicating survey expectations and results is an essential part of a strong engagement program strategy. 

Use the pre-launch and live templates below to customize and send to the people in your organization to prepare them to participate in Viva Glint survey programs. The templates are for guidance only and assume a six-week launch which may be longer than your timeline. Align your communications as appropriate. 

Sample communications are not generated in the Viva Glint platform. 

A variety of templates are available: 

- Pre-survey templates for introducing various audiences to the Viva Glint survey process 
- Pre-survey templates for various times prior to survey launch 
- Templates to provide leaders to training access 
- Survey reminder for when your survey is live 

Each template in the tables below is bookmarked on this page. Copy, paste, and customize for internal distribution. 

## Email template for your entire organization
