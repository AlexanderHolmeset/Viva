# Get all Microsoft Viva modules

[Microsoft Viva](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva) currently offers several apps that can make an impact on their own and become even more powerful when used together. Learn more about [individual Viva modules](discover-more-about-each-viva-module.md) and how you can use [two or more modules together](learn-how-to-combine-modules.md) to create personalized employee experiences for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
> New Microsoft Viva experiences have just been released or are coming soon. New Viva experiences will be incorporated into this solution for [Viva Engage](/viva/engage/overview), [Viva Goals](/viva/goals/intro-to-ms-viva-goals), and [Viva Sales](/viva/sales/introduction). Learn more about [new Viva experiences](/viva/getting-started-with-microsoft-viva#learn-more-about-new-viva-experiences).

Follow the guidance in this article if you know your organization wants all four Viva modules.

|Confirm you’ve got the right licensing in place. |Meet technical requirements.|Learn more about the roles in each phase.|Prepare to launch and scale adoption with end-users.|

## Step 1: Confirm the right licensing is in place

To get all four Viva modules, you'll need a license for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 (E1, A1, G1, E3, A3, G3, E5, A5, G5), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium, or Exchange Online Plan 1 or Plan 2 to be eligible for Microsoft Viva.

Then, you need to purchase the [Microsoft Viva suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/pricing?rtc=1) that includes:

- Viva Insights to improve employee and team productivity and wellbeing.
- Viva Learning (premium version) for employee skilling and growth.
- Viva Topics for organization and discovery of knowledge and expertise.
- Viva Engage to empower members of your organization to build meaningful connections.
- Viva Goals to align teams to your organization's priorities.

>[!NOTE]
> Viva Sales isn't included in the Viva suite license.

## Step 2: Meet technical requirements

After you’ve got the right licensing in place, review additional requirements to get the Viva module up and running. For more details, [review minimum requirements and planning considerations](discover-more-about-each-viva-module.md).

## Step 4: How to get started

Technically, the Viva apps don't need to be installed in a specific order. Each app has a unique setup and deployment process.

### Get started with Viva Connections

- Create a Viva Connections Dashboard with cards.
- Target cards to specific audiences.
- Prepare content for the Feed and Resources.
- Upload the app to the Teams admin center.
- [Review the getting started guide for Viva Connections.](connections/guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections.md)

### Get started with Viva Insights

- Decide which types of insights are needed ([personal](insights/personal/introduction.md), [team](insights/org-team-insights/teamwork-habits.md), [organization](insights/org-team-insights/org-trends.md), and [advanced](insights/index-orig.md)).

### Get started with Viva Learning

- [Choose which learning content sources to use.](learning/content-sources-365-admin-center.md)
- [Manage how content shows up for your org.](learning/use-tabs.md)
- [Review the getting started guide for Viva Learning.](learning/set-up-viva-learning.md)

### Get started with Viva Topics

- Choose which SharePoint sites you want to crawl for topics.
- Identify which topics, if any, you want to exclude from topic experiences.
- Choose which users you want to make topics visible to.
- Identify which users you want to give permissions to manage topics or to create or edit topics in the topic center.
- Choose the name that you want to give your topic center.
- Review the [Get your environment ready](topics/topic-experiences-get-ready.md) and [Set up Viva Topics](topics/set-up-topic-experiences.md) guidance.|

### Get started with Viva Goals

- Create an organization in Viva Goals and set organizational objectives and key results.

### Get started with Viva Sales

- Install Viva Sales from the Microsoft 365 admin center.
- Add the app to Microsoft Teams.
- Integrate Viva Sales with your CRM.

## Step 5: Prepare to launch and scale adoption with end users

All Viva apps don't need to be launched at the same time to be useful to your organization. Consider a phased approach based on the modules that are available, the most valuable to your organization, and which modules will be the most useful and appealing to specific audiences.

![Image of a workplace champion influencing others.](./media/viva-champion.png)

**Leverage champions and early adopters**: A champion will create a center of enthusiasm that grows adoption, build a circle of influence among their teams, identify business challenges and possible solutions, provide feedback to the project team and sponsors, and reduce strain on the core project team through active, ongoing engagement.

![Image of a chart that explains different ways to communicate with different audiences.](./media/viva-comms.png)

**Meet your audience where they are**: There are several methods of sharing the availability of the Viva modules like email, SharePoint news, or post in Teams or a Yammer community for example. [Get more information, templates, and resources to help your organization promote and adopt Microsoft Viva.](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/)

Consider where and how different audiences currently get news and announcements. For example, frontline workers might get the most important news in team meetings and from posters in break rooms, and hybrid workers might be used to getting SharePoint news in Outlook. Consider using the following methods to reach your audience:

- **Announce your organization’s instance of Microsoft Viva at an event**: Kick off the announcement about the availability of the modules at an all-hands (or sometimes called a Town Hall) meeting where everyone in the organization will attend or can view a recording later.
- **Use communication tools like SharePoint news and Yammer communities**: Share details about the launch along with any change management guidance or end-user training in an [organizational news post](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7#:%7E:text=In%20SharePoint%20Online%2C%20you%20can%20add%20news%20posts,instructions%20Create%20the%20news%20post%20.%20See%20More), [Yammer communities](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-a-conversation-in-yammer-da65b1c3-6651-4141-8dbd-d50d61b98a6e), and [Microsoft Teams channels.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-format-a-post-e66777da-636b-49eb-9408-b0d88b212885)
- **Consider hosting training events or offering office hours**: Make sure end-users get the most from Viva by offering ongoing support the first 30 days after launching.
- **Use the Viva email and poster templates**: Get a jump start on creating [communication materials for the Viva Connections launch.](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/)
