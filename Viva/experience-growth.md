## Growth: Learn, grow, and succeed with Microsoft Viva
If you've ever been a new employee, or an employee changing roles, or even a long-time employee in a large organization, you know that learning is paramount to success. Viva Learning and Viva Topics can provide the training and information needed to help employees thrive. Used together, employees won't have to disrupt their everyday flow of work to find the information they need quickly and easily.

## Viva Learning
Viva Learning is a centralized learning hub in Microsoft Teams that allows employees to access training and learning materials without leaving Teams. Your organization no longer needs a separate location for learning materials, and employees don't have to leave their normal flow of work to find and complete training.

Viva Learning is enabled by default for all Microsoft Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on Viva Learning at the organization level on the **Manage apps** page in the Microsoft Teams admin center. Learn how to [manage apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/manage-apps). Other settings, such as featured content, can be managed from the [Admin tab within Viva Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/learning/use-tabs).

The teams and people in your organization can discover, share, recommend, and learn from content provided by both your organization and partners.

## Viva Topics
Viva Topics helps to address a key business issue in many companies â€” providing the information to users when they need it. For example, new employees need to learn a lot of new information quickly, and may encounter terms and acronyms they know nothing about when reading through company information. To learn more, the user might need to step away from what they are doing and spend valuable time searching for details, such as information about what the term is, who in the organization is a subject matter expert, and maybe sites and documents that are related to the term. Now they can just hover over a term that has a topic associated with it, and learn that information within the flow of work.

Viva Topics uses AI to automatically search for and identify topics in your organization. It compiles information about them, such as a short description, people working on the topic, and sites, files, and pages that are related to it.

 A [knowledge manager or contributor](/viva/topics/topic-experiences-roles) can update the topic information as needed. The topics are available to your users, which means that for every instance of the topic that appears in a modern SharePoint site in news and pages, the text will be highlighted. Users can choose to select the topic to learn more about it through the topic details. Topics can also be found in SharePoint Search.
