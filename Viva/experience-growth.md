## Help people learn, grow, and succeed
If you've ever been a new employee, or an employee changing roles, or even a long-time employee in a large organization, you know that learning is paramount to success. Viva Learning and Viva Topics can provide the training and information needed to help employees thrive.

## Viva Learning
Viva Learning is a centralized learning hub in Microsoft Teams that allows employees to access training and learning materials without leaving Teams.

Viva Learning provides learning content from sources such as LinkedIn, sources that you set up, and also customized learning that your organization provides. The teams and people in your organizzation can discover, share, recommend, and learn from content libraries provided by both your organization and partners.

## Viva Topics
Viva Topics uses Microsoft AI technology, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph, Search, and other components and services to bring knowledge to your users in the Microsoft 365 apps they use everyday, starting with SharePoint modern pages, Microsoft Search, and Search in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Excel.

Viva Topics helps to address a key business issue in many companies â€” providing the information to users when they need it. For example, new employees need to learn a lot of new information quickly, and encounter terms they know nothing about when reading through company information. To learn more, the user might need to step away from what they are doing and spend valuable time searching for details, such as information about what the term is, who in the organization is a subject matter expert, and maybe sites and documents that are related to the term.

Viva Topics uses AI to automatically search for and identify topics in your organization. It compiles information about them, such as a short description, people working on the topic, and sites, files, and pages that are related to it. A knowledge manager or contributor can choose to update the topic information as needed. The topics are available to your users, which means that for every instance of the topic that appears in a modern SharePoint site in news and pages, the text will be highlighted. Users can choose to select the topic to learn more about it through the topic details. Topics can also be found in SharePoint Search.
