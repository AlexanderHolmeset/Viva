# Set up Microsoft Viva

Microsoft Viva is an organizing layer for employee experiences that puts knowledge, skills, connections, and insights in the natural flow of the workday when they’re needed in Teams, SharePoint, and other Microsoft 365 services.

Microsoft Viva consists of several modules including Viva Topics, Viva Insights, Viva Learning, Viva Connections, Viva Sales, Viva Goals, and Viva Engage. To set up the whole suite, you’ll set up each module individually starting from a centralized Viva setup page.

## Start setting up

1. Sign in to your account as a Microsoft 365 admin.
2. In the search bar, enter Viva.
3. Select **Microsoft Viva**.

Alternatively, you can go to the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Setup** on the left navigation, and then select the **Microsoft Viva** tile.


This brings you to the [Microsoft Viva admin page](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/featureexplorer/collections/VivaExperiences).

Things you can do on this page:

- **Licenses and roles**:  You can select **Manage licenses** or **Manage roles** to go directly to the Microsoft 365 Licenses page or to the Microsoft 365 Role assignments page. On the Role assignments page, you can search for Viva in the search box to narrow the roles to those specific to Viva.
- **Plan types**:  You can see the type of Viva plan purchased or included with Microsoft 365 in the **Plan type** column.
- **Assigned admins**:  You can see quickly whether admin roles have been assigned for each app, and who the roles are assigned to in the **Admins** column. Hover over the profile circles to get the names of people who are assigned roles
- **App pages**:  You can select an app to go to that app's settings page.
- **Briefing email**: Select the **Manage briefing email in Viva** to select whether people in your organization should receive [briefing emails](/viva/insights/personal/Briefing/be-overview?WT.mc_id=365AdminCSH_inproduct).

## App settings pages

Each app has its own settings page, and they may differ. The Viva Insights and Viva Learning pages utilize the new admin experience. Other pages will evolve over time. Here's an example of the Learning admin page:

In this example you can:

- See at a glance which settings are required in the **Priority** column.
- Select a setting in the list, and get a panel where you can set the options without leaving the page. In this example, you see the panel to assign knowledge managers.
- Select the **More information** tab to get detailed guidance on setting up the app.
