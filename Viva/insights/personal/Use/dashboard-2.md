# MyAnalytics dashboard

[![Viva announcement.](../../images/viva-banner-mya.png)](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/insights)

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

Thank you for trying Viva Insights and MyAnalytics. Welcome to your new personalized dashboard that gives you valuable new insights into how to increase focus, achieve work-life balance, and improve your work relationships and team collaboration.

**To open the dashboard**: Go to [myanalytics.microsoft.com](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com)

>[!Note]
>Only you can see your data, see [Privacy FAQ](../overview/mya-faq.md#privacy) for details.

## Home

The dashboard opens to the **Home** page that shows you statistics about your work patterns over the past month, including your focus and collaboration time, how many days you were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively you are networking with your coworkers.

![Your work patterns.](../../Images/mya/use/home-2.png)

## Focus and Wellbeing

The Focus section helps you understand whether you have enough time for uninterrupted individual work and provides tips on how to protect your calendar and manage distractions.

The Wellbeing section shows how well you are disconnecting from work during your time off and suggests ways to reduce stress and burnout.

For more details and tips, see [Focus](../use/focus.md) and [Wellbeing](../use/wellbeing.md).

>[!Tip]
>The _focus plan_ in MyAnalytics helps you set aside regular focus time for your top-priority work. This plan helps you schedule one to two hours every day to focus, with an option to book that time automatically. During the booked focus time, it silences chats in Teams and in Skype for Business. For more information, see [MyAnalytics focus plan](focus-plan.md).  

## Network and Collaboration

The Network section shows information about your relationships with the people in your network, which is based on your work activities over the past year.

The Collaboration section shows the people you actively collaborated with based on your work activities over the past month, such as email, chats, calls, and meetings.

For more details and tips, see [Network](../use/network.md) and [Collaboration](../use/collaboration.md).

<!-- REMOVE THIS (6/2/2020) FOR THE TIME BEING. PETERB WILL SAY WHEN TO REINSTATE IT. AT THAT TIME, ALSO RE-ADD LEADERSHIP.MD TO THE TOC AND UN-HIDE IT FROM WEB SEARCHES. -->

## Leadership

If you're a people manager, the Leadership page shows information about your relationships with team members. For more details, see [Leadership](leadership.md).

## Productivity insights

MyAnalytics gives you insights into your work patterns around focus, network, wellbeing, and collaboration over the past four weeks. These insights show observations and trends of your most recent work habits based on your Office 365 data.  

![Weekly digest insight.](../../Images/mya/use/digest-insight.png)

These insights are also available on your MyAnalytics dashboard home page as well as on the specific outcome pages. Select **View Suggestions** to see research-based recommendations on how to improve your work patterns.

![Productivity insights.](../../Images/mya/use/productivity.png)

If you donâ€™t meet the qualifications for specific productivity insights on the dashboard, the cards will show you educational tips instead. Educational tips are only available in the dashboard.

### Educational tips

Educational insights give you work productivity and wellbeing tips and ideas, which come from a variety of resources, such as academic and industry research. Viva Insights refreshes these cards periodically to reflect your most recent work patterns. You can come back at a later time to check out new sets of productivity and educational insights.

## Config Settings

Your personalized insights are based on the working days, working hours, and time zone that you set in the **Work week** section of **Config Settings**. Changes to these settings are reflected in next week's data.

In **Plan configuration**, you can personalize your focus plan. You can select how much focus time you want to schedule for what time of day, if you want to automatically book it or only get reminders to schedule it for the next two weeks, and more. For more details, see [Focus plan](../use/focus-plan.md).

In Delay Delivery, you can turn the feature On or Off for the option of delaying delivery of an email during your co-workers configured working hours.

If you're a manager or team lead with a P1 license, you can select **Edit team** in **Team settings** to add or remove team members and your team insights will update accordingly. If you're not a manager, select **I'm not a manager** to hide this section.
