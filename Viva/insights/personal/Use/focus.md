# Focus

The Focus page on the [MyAnalytics dashboard](dashboard-2.md) shows weekly averages for the time you have available to focus and time spent collaborating with others in your network.

## Productivity insights

These insights are based on your recent activity in Microsoft 365. Select **View Suggestions** to get ideas about how you might change or improve your current work patterns, such as booking focus time in your calendar and muting notifications when trying to concentrate.

## About the metrics

* **Collaboration** is based on time spent in meetings, emails, chats, and calls with Teams and Skype for Business. To learn more about how these metrics are calculated, see [Collaboration](collaboration.md).

* **Available to focus** is equal to your working hours minus your collaboration hours; it shows the amount of time you have left over each week for individual work. Time that you block out on your calendar with no other attendees is counted toward the **Available to focus** metric, not toward the **Collaboration** metric. Additionally, any day that you mark as "Out of office" on your calendar is excluded from this calculation.

These metrics are calculated only for your working hours, as determined by your Outlook calendar.

For example: If your working hours are set as 9 am to 5 pm daily (8 working hours per day) and you spent 30 hours in meetings, emails, chats, and calls in a given week, your dashboard will show 75% collaboration and 25% time available to focus for that week.

## Focus plan

The _focus plan_ in MyAnalytics helps you set aside regular focus time for your top-priority work. When you enroll in this plan MyAnalytics automatically schedules up to two hours of focus time for you every day. During the booked focus time, it silences chats in Teams and in Skype for Business. For more information, see [MyAnalytics focus plan](focus-plan.md).

## Focus tips

* **Block focus time on your calendar**:

  * It can be hard to go deep on challenging work if you only have small chunks of time to focus in between meetings or are easily distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help improve your concentration and effectiveness.
  * Prioritize any focus time you book and do your best to avoid accepting meetings that overlap with it. In the same way, be respectful of double-booking your team’s blocked time.

* **Manage notifications and interruptions**: Multitasking can slow you down; after checking even just one email or chat, it can take a significant amount of time to refocus. To improve concentration, try turning off notifications and checking your email inbox less frequently.

* **Group your meetings together on your calendar**: If your calendar is fragmented with meetings, try grouping meetings on your calendar so you have longer free blocks available to focus.

* **Evaluate and shorten your meetings**: Meetings are essential for many jobs, but they sometimes last longer than needed. An easy starting point for reducing your meeting load is to review your recurring meetings and make sure they're a good use of time each week. Also consider dividing up meetings with coworkers and sharing notes afterwards if you’re not all needed in the room at the same time.
