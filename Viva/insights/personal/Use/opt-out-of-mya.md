# Opt out of the dashboard

All users can use the Viva Insights dashboard to opt-out. When you opt out:

* You will no longer be able to access the dashboard or other personal insights features, including the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md).
* You will stop receiving [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) and [email digests](../use/email-digests-3.md).
* Your email activity will not be included in other users' [email open rates](../use/use-the-insights.md#track-email-and-document-open-rates).

## To opt out of the dashboard

1. Open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

4. For Viva Insights, change the setting to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to a week for your saved changes to take effect.

### If you have multiple accounts

If you have more than one Microsoft 365 account, you might also have more than one subscription to Viva Insights. You can decide which accounts to retain and which ones to opt out of.

Each email account that has a Viva Insights subscription receives regular emails with subject lines such as "Focus edition" or "Wellbeing edition." To opt out of one or more of these subscriptions, first answer the following question:

* Which of my accounts receive emails from Viva Insights subscriptions that I want to opt out of?

You will use the answer to this question in the following procedure:

#### To opt out of multiple accounts

1. Open a web browser in incognito mode.
2. In the incognito browser session, open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com). You will see a Microsoft **Sign in** dialog box. 
3. Sign in by using the credentials of an email account whose Viva Insights subscription you want to end.
4. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.

5. Under **Viva Insights**, select **Settings**.
6. For Viva Insights, change the setting to **Off**.

7. Repeat steps 1 - 6 for each account whose Viva Insights subscription you want to opt out of. 
 
## If I opt out, can I opt back in?

Yes, if you opt yourself out, or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to Viva Insights.

To opt in, repeat the steps in [To opt out](#to-opt-out-of-the-dashboard), but in **Step 4**, change the setting for the **Dashboard** to **On**.
