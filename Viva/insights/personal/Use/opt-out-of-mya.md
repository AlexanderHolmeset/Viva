### If you have multiple accounts

If you have more than one Microsoft 365 account, you might also have more than one subscription to Viva Insights. You can decide which accounts to retain and which ones to opt out of.

Each email account that has a Viva Insights subscription receives regular emails from Microsoft Viva. To opt out of one or more of these subscriptions, first answer the following question:

* Which of my accounts receive emails from Viva Insights subscriptions that I want to opt out of?

You will use the answer to this question in the following procedure:

#### To opt out of multiple accounts

1. Open a web browser in incognito mode.
2. In the incognito browser session, open your [dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com). You'll see a Microsoft **Sign in** dialog box. 
3. Sign in by using the credentials of an email account whose Viva Insights subscription you want to end.
4. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top right.
