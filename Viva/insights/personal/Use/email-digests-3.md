# Viva Insights digest emails

If you're a subscriber of Microsoft Viva Insights, you will receive informative emails on the following occasions:

* Up to four weeks after being assigned a MyAnalytics license, you'll receive a [welcome message](#microsoft-viva-welcome-message) that introduces the service.
* Once a month, you'll receive a [digest email](#digest-email-from-microsoft-viva) that summarizes data about your work patterns so that you can improve them.

## Microsoft Viva welcome message

Up to four weeks after the administrator assigns licenses with the MyAnalytics service to users, they'll receive a Welcome message from Microsoft Viva in their Outlook inbox.

Users do not receive the Welcome digest outside of their work week. For example, if necessary, the delivery is delayed to Monday to keep it from being delivered during a weekend.

Here's an example of a Viva Insights welcome message:

## Digest email from Microsoft Viva

_**Applies to:** Microsoft Viva elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. Only users who have MyAnalytics service plans enabled will receive the Viva Insights digest email. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

As a Microsoft Viva user, you'll receive a monthly digest with suggestions to help you better understand your work patterns and improve your wellbeing and productivity. This digest is a notification generated by the system and delivered to your Outlook inbox at the start of each month. (You can tell it's the digest email from Microsoft Viva when the subject line starts with "Your monthly" and the sender is viva-noreply@microsoft.com.)

Monthly digest emails include insights on some of the following work patterns:

* **Focus** - Find ways to increase your focus hours, so you can accomplish deep work and unleash your creativity.
* **Wellbeing** - See if you're getting good balance between work and personal time, then find ways to disconnect and unwind after hours.
* **Network** - See who's in your network and make sure you're keeping up with important contacts and relationships.
* **Collaboration** - Get tips on how to plan your calendar, spend less time in low-quality meetings, and write more effective emails.
* **Team insights** - If you're a team manager or lead with a P1 license, you'll also see insights about your team and suggestions on how to help improve or maintain your team's wellbeing and effectiveness. For more details about team insights, see [Team insights](team-insights.md). You can add or remove team members in [Config settings](dashboard-2.md#config-settings).

## Opt out of digests

If you do not want to receive the monthly digest from Microsoft Viva, you can opt out in either of two ways &mdash; on your MyAnalytics dashboard or in the digest email itself.

### Opt out on the MyAnalytics dashboard

1. Open your [MyAnalytics dashboard](https://myanalytics.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon at the top right.
3. Under **MyAnalytics**, select **Settings**.
4. Under **Monthly digest**, change the setting to **Off**.
5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

### Opt out in the digest email

* Scroll to the bottom of the digest email and select **Unsubscribe**.

   >[!Note]
   >After you select **Unsubscribe**, you will see the **Sorry to see you go** page. This page shows your email address in the sentence, "You (<name@domain.com> have been unsubscribed from the **digest email**." Verify that the email address that is shown is the correct email address for you. If this email address is not yours, you will not be unsubscribed.

### If I am opted out, can I opt back in?

Yes; if you opt yourself out or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to the digest.

>[!Note]
> Skype for Business data is usually prompt. However, in rare instances, users can experience delays of up to two to four days. For details, see [MyAnalytics FAQ](../Overview/MyA-faq.md)

### After unsubscribing from the monthly digest, why am I still receiving them?

If you have multiple Microsoft 365 emails, you might be getting the digest for a different email address than the one you unsubscribed with. Confirm that the email address at the bottom of your digest email is the same as the one on the unsubscribe page.

If this email address does not match your own, make sure that you are signed in with the same account in both the MyAnalytics dashboard and in email, and then repeat the steps in [Opt out of digests](#opt-out-of-digests).
