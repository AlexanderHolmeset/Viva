# Shared focus plan

You can join the focus plan in MyAnalytics, which helps you block regular time for your top-priority work by scheduling up to four hours every day to focus. You can also start a focus plan to share with your team or co-workers, to encourage good productivity habits.

An enrolled manager can also invite their team to book focus time daily to have uninterrupted time to get their work done. This shared focus plan helps the team build a shared productivity habit.

Any user with a Viva Insights Premium license can start a shared focus plan, Recipients of the invitation to the plan need not have a premium license. <!--Mandy Ndoro: IC users can have v-team they can invite to a shared focus plan.-->

## Create a shared focus plan

In Viva Insights, you can start a shared focus plan on the following pages:

* On the My Team page, by using the **Recommended plan** card.
* On the My Team page, by selecting a card in the **Plans** row.
* On the Home page, by using the **Recommended plan** card.
* On the Home page, by selecting a card in the **Plans** row.

This example procedure shows how to create a shared plan by using the first of these choices, the **Recommended plan** card on the My Team page. Each day, the **Recommended plan** card shows a different option, a different plan that you can share. On the day that it offers the shared-focus-plan option, you can follow the steps in this procedure. On other days, you can share that day’s offering, or you can wait for the shared-focus-plan option to reappear on a later day.

Alternatively, you can use a card in the **Plans** row to create a shared focus plan. (The **Plans** row always shows all the shared plans that you can start.)

1. In [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), open Viva Insights.

2. On the menu bar at the top, select **My team**.

3. On the **Recommended plan** card, select **Get started**:

   ![Get started](../../Images/mya/use/recommended-get-started.png)

4. On the **Start a Shared Focus Plan** card, select **Let’s do this**:

   ![Start creating shared plan](../../Images/mya/use/start-plan-lets-do-this.png)

5. On the **Customize your shared focus plan** card, choose the number of hours per day, the general time of day, and whether to silence notifications, and then select **Next**.

   ![Select settings](../../Images/mya/use/select-settings.png)

6. On the **Who would you like to invite** page, select people to receive invitations to the focus plan from among those on your team. Your team members will pre-populate the list of **Recipients**; you can remove people from or add people to this list. When you’re done, select **Next**:

   ![Invite recipients](../../Images/mya/use/who-to-invite.png)

7. On the **Would you like to include a note** page, choose whether to add a note for your recipients. You can accept the draft note as it appears on the page, edit it, or delete the note. When done, select **Send invitation**:

   ![Include an optional note](../../Images/mya/use/include-a-note.png)

   After you send the invitation, you’ll see a message that reads **All done!**

   ![Invitation is sent: All done](../../Images/mya/use/all-done.png)

Immediately after you select **Send invitation**, notifications are sent to the recipients. These notifications remain available to your recipients for eight weeks or until you cancel the shared focus plan.

## Respond to a shared focus plan invitation

The steps in this procedure begin after you receive an invitation to join a shared focus plan. This invitation first appears as a notification such as the following, which you would see in the upper-right corner of Teams:

   ![Notification of invitation](../../Images/mya/use/notif-of-invite.png)

As an invitee to a plan, you can find a reminder of your pending invitation on the Viva Insights **Home** page under **Top actions for today**:

   ![Pending invitation](../../Images/mya/use/pending-invitation.png)

1. In [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), do one of the following:

   * Select the notification in the upper-right corner of Teams.

   * On the card under **Top actions for today**, select **Open invite**.

2. In the **Shared focus plan** invitation that opens, select **Join plan**:

   ![Receive invitation to join the shared plan](../../Images/mya/use/receive-invite.png)

   >[!Note]
   >Selecting **Dismiss** will dismiss the invitation and suppress any reminders of it.

   Before you selected **Join plan**, if you were _not_ already enrolled in a focus plan, you now see the **All done!** page. If this is the case, skip the rest of this procedure.

   ![Plan is joined. All done.](../../Images/mya/use/all-done.png)

3.	Before you selected **Join plan**, if you _were_ already enrolled in a focus plan, you now see the **You are already enrolled** page:

    ![Already enrolled](../../Images/mya/use/already-enrolled.png)

   On this page, you have the following choices:

   * You now can now switch from your individual plan to the shared plan. To do this, select **Join plan**.

   * If you’d like to join the shared plan but first change its details, select **Edit settings**. You can then choose the number of hours per day, the general time of day, and whether to silence notifications; when you’re done making these settings, select **Join plan**.

     ![Select focus plan settings](../../Images/mya/use/select-focus-plan-settings.png)

   * If you’d rather stick with your current (individual) focus plan, close this page by selecting the **X**. The invitation will no longer be visible, and your current focus plan will be unaffected.

4. On the **All done** page, select **Done**.

   ![You've joined the plan](../../Images/mya/use/all-done-joined.png)

You have now successfully joined your team’s shared focus plan.

## Check the details of your shared focus plan

* To check the details of your new plan, open the **Home** page of Viva Insights and find the **Plans** row:

   ![You've joined the plan](../../Images/mya/use/page-showing-plans-row-2.png)
  
   The plan’s details would appear in a **Shared focus plan** card:

   ![Shared-focus-plan card](../../Images/mya/use/shared-focus-plan-card.png)

   Note that if you have a Viva Insights Premium license, you can also see the plan details on the **My team** page.

   If you are the creator of a shared focus plan, you can also view its details in a card on the **Plans** row of the Viva Insights **Home** page:

   ![Shared-focus-plan card](../../Images/mya/use/your-shared-focus-plan.png)

## Leave a shared focus plan

This section has two parts: how to leave a shared focus plan as a [participant in the plan](#as-a-plan-participant), and how to leave it if you are the plan's [organizer](#as-the-plan-organizer). 

### As a plan participant

As a plan participant, you can leave the shared focus plan by selecting **Leave plan** on the **Shared focus plan** card on the **Plans row** of Viva Insights.  

   ![Leave plan from Plans row](../../Images/mya/use/leave-plan.png)

After you leave a shared plan, you will still be enrolled in your personal focus plan. To opt out of the personal focus plan or change your focus plan settings, go to the **Settings** page. To do this:

1. Select the ellipsis (…) in the upper right corner of Viva Insights and then select **Settings**.

   ![Select ellipsis and then Settings](../../Images/mya/use/ellipsis-settings.png)

2. On the Viva Insights **Settings** page, select **Protect time**.

   ![Select ellipsis and then Settings](../../Images/mya/use/protect-time.png)

3. In the **Focus plan preferences** section, select **Leave plan**.

### As the plan organizer

After you have organized a shared focus plan, you can leave the plan. To do so, select **Leave plan** on the **Shared focus plan** card on the Plans row of Viva Insights, and then select **Confirm**.

   ![Select ellipsis and then Settings](../../Images/mya/use/confirm-leave-plan.png)

Note that your departure from a focus plan does not opt any user out of the plan. Plan participants remain enrolled in the focus plan.

## Concepts

The following sections provide information that can help you as you create or monitor focus plans.  

### Automatic booking of focus time

After you set automatic booking as your preference, MyAnalytics starts looking for time on your Outlook calendar to set aside as focus time. The time that it books on your calendar appears in a different color and is labeled "Focus time":  

![Focus prompt in the digest.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-time-on-your-calendar.png)

Focus time never creates a calendar conflict; that is, focus time will not be booked over any existing calendar event, such as all-day meetings, booked personal time, or appointments.

Although two hours is the maximum length of a focus-time block that can be scheduled automatically, you can extend your focus time, by hand, in your Outlook calendar.

#### Booking schedule

MyAnalytics books focus time two weeks in advance. For example: when you open your calendar on a Monday, you should see focus time booked every day of the current week and all the way through the Friday of the following week. Each weekend it looks for time blocks in the next week out and books time accordingly. 

#### How time slots are selected

The time it reserves for you depends on the time you have open during the day. MyAnalytics starts its search at the beginning of your workday, as it is defined in your Outlook settings.

MyAnalytics also respects the **Do not schedule focus time earlier than** setting in the **Plan configuration** dialog box. For example, if you set this to 9:00 AM, MyAnalytics will select no focus-time slots that begin earlier than 9:00 AM.  

MyAnalytics also prioritizes your preferences for length of focus time slots and part of day (morning or afternoon). For example, if you choose four hours of focus time and choose afternoon, MyAnalytics first scans your calendar to find four-hour open slots in the afternoon. If it finds no four-hour open slots in the afternoon, it continues to scan your calendar to find four-hour open slots in the morning. If only smaller amounts of time are available, it can book focus blocks as short as 30 minutes.

After it books a block on one day, it then moves on to the next day to find the next suitable block, based on your preferences. (In most cases, it creates only one block of focus time per day.)

#### Lunchtime

MyAnalytics considers the time from 12:00 PM (noon) to 1:00 PM as time for the midday meal. If you have automatic booking turned on, MyAnalytics tries to book any other time of day first. If it finds no other blocks of time available, it will then book focus time during the lunchtime period.

### You can mute chats during focus time  

You can choose whether, during focus time, your status changes to "focusing" and chat notifications in Teams are silenced. When the focus time appointment ends, your status reverts back to your previous status. Note that you can set priority contacts in Teams to ensure you don’t miss important messages during focus time.

For more information, see [Manage notifications in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/manage-notifications-in-teams-1cc31834-5fe5-412b-8edb-43fecc78413d).

### Focus plan monthly digest

After you enroll in a focus plan, the content of the monthly digest becomes tailored to your participation in the plan. It might, for example, remind you to book focus time for days on which none is set aside.
