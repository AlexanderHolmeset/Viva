# Viva Insights app redesign

To make it easier to move around and find new features on the Viva Insights app, we're doing two things:

* Updating the navigation experience on Viva Insights in Teams and on the web
* Consolidating several existing tabs into four

## What's happening?

After we roll out these changes, you'll be able to move around the Viva Insights app through a left-positioned navigation bar instead of the current, top-aligned navigation. You'll also find Viva Insights content consolidated across four tabs. We talk more about these tabs later in this article.

When will these changes happen?

We'll roll out changes between February 1 and March 31, 2022.
