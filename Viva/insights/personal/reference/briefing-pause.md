# Pausing the briefing email from Microsoft Viva 

We’re taking some time to improve the Briefing email and give you more personalized content in your daily messages. As a result, we’ll take a break from sending you your daily Briefing starting on January 15th, 2023. 

While you’ll stop receiving the Briefing email for a while, you’ll still have access to Viva Insights features. If you rely on different features within Briefing—like preparing for meetings, reviewing outstanding tasks, or booking focus time—read this article to learn how you can find them in your Viva Insights Outlook add-in or Viva Insights app in Teams and web. You'll continue to receive semi-monthly digest emails with insights and recommendations to build healthy work habits.

## Prepare for upcoming meetings 

In your daily Briefing, you might have found the day's first three meetings that had at least one suggested action, like reviewing a related document. 

**Where you'll find a similar feature:** *Outlook add-in*

The Viva Insights Outlook add-in includes a [Prepare for your meetings](../use/use-insights.md#prepare-for-your-meetings) section,which shows you a list of upcoming meetings that you've organized or that you've been invited to for the next seven days. Select this card for key insights per meeting, like percentage of invitees who have accepted.

## Follow up on outstanding tasks 

Based on your email activity, your Briefing might have shown you follow-up reminders for tasks.

**Where you'll find a similar feature:** *Outlook add-in* and *Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web*

The Viva Insights Outlook add-in includes a [View outstanding tasks](../use/use-insights.md#view-outstanding-tasks) section with task reminders. These reminders are based on emails you've sent and requests your colleagues have emailed you over the last 14 days. The add-in also includes a [Follow up on your requests](../use/use-insights.md#follow-up-on-your-requests) section to help you check in on requests you've made to your colleagues. 

:::image type="content" source="../../Images/MyA/reference/oai-outstanding-tasks-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the View outstanding tasks card in the Viva Insights Outlook add-in.":::

The **Stay connected** tab in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web also has a **Suggested tasks** section. If you've pinned people as important, you'll notice their tasks show up first, under **Pinned**.

## Protect time for focused work 

In your daily Briefing, you were able to protect time for focused work before your calendar filled up with meetings. 

**Where you'll find a similar feature:** *Outlook add-in* and *Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web*

The Viva Insights Outlook add-in includes a [Book time to focus](../use/use-insights.md#book-time-to-focus) section to help you protect time for focused work and also minimize notifications by Teams chats and calls during your focus time. 

:::image type="content" source="../../Images/MyA/reference/oai-focus-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Book time to focus card in the Viva Insights Outlook add-in.":::

You can also book focus time through the [Protect time](../teams/viva-insights-protect-time.md) tab in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web.

## Start your day with a guided meditation 

In the **Headspace** section of the Briefing email, you were able to launch a guided meditation to start your day grounded and focused. Discover a curated set of guided meditations through the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web. Just select the **Play** button on the [Headspace](../teams/viva-insights-headspace.md) card in the **Home** tab.
