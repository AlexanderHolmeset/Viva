# Productivity

On the **Productivity** tab, you'll find centralized insights and actions that help you as an information worker get your work done more effectively.

The tab provides these features:

* **Effective meetings**: Understand and decrease non-productive meeting time through meeting effectiveness surveys, meeting category insights, and meeting habits. Read more about how you can use Viva Insights to craft better meetings in [Effective meetings](effective-meetings.md).

* **Suggested tasks**: Stay on top of your work with tasks that Viva Insights surfaces through unread shared documents, meetings you haven't responded to, and Teams chats. Learn more about how this feature works in [Suggested tasks](suggested-tasks.md).

    <!--need updated image that doesn't contain unread docs content-->
