# Quiet time

Research shows that long hours and the pressure to always be available can lead to employee burnout. The amount of time you spend collaborating outside of business hours can be an indicator for your risk of burnout, even as you and your team embrace flexibility.

To protect your non-working hours, and to help you disconnect and recharge from work, use quiet time in Microsoft Viva Insights. When you set up quiet time, we'll silence mobile notifications from Outlook and Teams, depending on the preferences you set.

## Set up quiet time

Here's how you get your quiet time set up:

1. Go to the **Wellbeing** tab in your Viva Insights app.
1. In the **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section, find the **Disconnect with quiet time** card, then select **Set quiet time**.

1. On the resulting page, select when you want Viva Insights to start and stop silencing Outlook and Teams notifications. In **Mute mobile notifications all day**, pick days you want Viva Insights to mute notifications for a full 24 hours.

You can change your quiet time settings whenever you need to:

1. Select the ellipses (**...**) at the top-right of your Viva Insights app, then select **Settings**.
