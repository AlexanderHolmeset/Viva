# Effective meetings

*This experience is part of a rolling release set to complete in October 2022*

## Meeting effectiveness surveys

The journey to transforming an organization’s meeting culture starts with measuring how people are doing in their meetings. Microsoft Viva Insights can help you improve your meeting effectiveness, build a feedback culture within your team and company by using meeting effectiveness surveys.

If you're opted in, Viva Insights will automatically send meeting participants a survey asking for feedback about your meetings. This feedback is aggregated into a meeting rating in **Effective meetings**. You’ll also see personalized insights about what you’re doing well and opportunities to make any improvements.

This feedback is designed to help you improve your individual meeting habits over time, as well as your team and company’s collective meeting habits.

## Privacy by design

The meeting effectiveness surveys are only sent for scheduled meetings that have five or more participants (including the meeting organizer). We also check whether the attendees who get those surveys stay in the meetings for at least five minutes. To help mitigate survey fatigue in survey participants, 10% of qualified meetings get the surveys. Providing meeting feedback is optional for all participants.

As the meeting organizer, you’ll only see aggregated results in Viva Insights. You won't see who sent what suggestions within the aggregated feedback.
