# Effective meetings

*This experience is part of a rolling release set to complete in October 2022. It's available to users with a Viva Insights subscription. Refer to [Plans and environments](../Overview/plans-environments.md) for more information.*

## Meeting category insights

You can use **Meeting category insights** in **Effective meetings** to help understand how you’re allocating time across your Outlook meeting categories.
To set up Outlook meeting categories, refer to [Assign a color category to a calendar appointment, meeting, or event (microsoft.com)](https://support.microsoft.com/office/assign-a-color-category-to-a-calendar-appointment-meeting-or-event-750596d9-707d-4412-8c0e-7fdc0fc52527).
  
**Meeting category insights** shows you how many hours you’re spending in meetings, then breaks down the time you spend in each of your categories.

You can customize what you see here. If you want to:

* Analyze a specific category, select it from the checklist to the left.

* Pick a specific timeframe, use the dropdown menu in the top-right. You can choose from **Last 3 months**, **Last 4 weeks**, or **Next 4 weeks**.

>[!Important]
>If you haven’t categorized any meetings between the last three months and next four weeks, these insights won’t be available to you. However, you’ll have access to them once you categorize any meeting within this time period, as long as you have a Viva Insights subscription.


## Meeting effectiveness surveys

The journey to transforming an organization’s meeting culture starts with measuring how people are doing in their meetings. Microsoft Viva Insights can help you improve your meeting effectiveness, build a feedback culture within your team and company by using meeting effectiveness surveys.

If you're opted in, Viva Insights will automatically send meeting participants a survey asking for feedback about your meetings. This feedback is aggregated into a meeting rating in **Effective meetings**. You’ll also see personalized insights about what you’re doing well and opportunities to make any improvements.

This feedback is designed to help you improve your individual meeting habits over time, as well as your team and company’s collective meeting habits.

## Privacy by design

The meeting effectiveness surveys are only sent for scheduled meetings that have five or more participants (including the meeting organizer). We also check whether the attendees who get those surveys stay in the meetings for at least five minutes. To help mitigate survey fatigue in survey participants, 10% of qualified meetings get the surveys. Providing meeting feedback is optional for all participants.

As the meeting organizer, you’ll only see aggregated results in Viva Insights. You won't see who sent what suggestions within the aggregated feedback.

## Opt in or out of surveys

You can opt in or out of getting feedback about your meetings.

1. In the Viva Insights app, select **Settings**.
2. For **Meeting effectiveness surveys**, select to turn the setting **On** or **Off**, and then select **Save**. This setting defaults to **On**.
