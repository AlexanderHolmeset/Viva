## Schedule focus time

Research shows that it can take an average of 23 minutes to refocus on a task after being interrupted. Constant distractions during focused work can cause higher stress and lower productivity. It is difficult to focus on challenging work when you only have small chunks of time available between meetings or are distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions can help you make progress on your important tasks and projects.

Viva Insights can help you protect time for focused work and minimize notifications (and thus distraction) from Teams chats and calls while focusing.

### Book focus time or a plan

You can schedule focus time on the **Protect time** page, as follows:

* **Book focus time** – Use this section to reserve time slots for focused work during the next two or more days.

  * After you select **Book time**, you'll see **Focused time booked**. If you see **Review meeting conflict**, select it to view your calendar and resolve the conflict.
  * If you have selected **Book time** and decide that you don’t need it anymore, you can delete the focus time block from your calendar.
  * Before booking time, you can select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to change the name of the focus time block, which automatically updates the subject for the scheduled focus time.

* **Focus plan** – Within **Focus plan**, select **Get started** to create a focus plan.

  * If this isn't your first time using a focus plan, you'll automatically be set up with the default settings from your last plan. Then based on the prompt, you can then select **Edit settings** to make any changes.
  * If this is your first focus plan, you'll be prompted to select the following options:

    * **Do this later**, which skips the prompts and simply enrolls you in a default plan based on your settings.
    * How much focus time you want to schedule each day.
    * Whether you prefer to focus in the morning or afternoon.
    * Whether you want a Teams reminder to begin focus mode.
    * Whether you want Teams to silence notifications during your scheduled focus time.

At any time after the initial setup, you can confirm or change any of the options or leave the plan by selecting the ellipses (**...**) at the top right of the Viva Insights app, selecting **Settings**, then selecting **Protect time** from the left pane.

## Create other plans

*Applies to: users with Viva Insights premium licenses*

In addition to focus plans, Viva Insights can also help you protect time on your calendar for scheduled breaks, learning, and message catch-up time. You can configure these plans to match your needs by setting a target amount of blocked time, and you can also personalize your booking preferences.  

### To create a breaks, learning, or message catch-up plan

You can create your plan in one of two ways: through the Viva Insights app or through the Briefing email you get on Fridays.

#### Through the Viva Insights app

To create a plan through the Viva Insights app, follow these steps:

1. Open the Viva Insights app, select the ellipses in the top-right corner of your screen, then select **Settings**.

### Learn more about booking time for plans

To learn more about the concepts behind these plans, refer to [Focus plan](../Use/focus-plan.md#concepts).

## Configure quiet time

Research shows that long hours and the pressure to always be available can lead to employee burnout. The amount of time you spend collaborating outside of business hours can be an indicator that you are at risk of burnout, even as you and your team embrace flexibility.

This feature can help protect your quiet time, which is the hours each day when you want to disconnect from work and recharge. To minimize work related interruptions, you can schedule when you want mobile notifications from Outlook and Teams to automatically be muted.

In the **Quiet time** section on the **Protect time** page, if you haven't scheduled quiet time and are prompted to, select **Let's go**. You are then prompted to select a start and end time for when to mute mobile notifications from Outlook and Teams. In **Mute mobile notifications all day**, you can also select which days to mute notifications for the full 24 hours.

After the initial setup, you'll see the following options in **Configure your quiet time**. You can get here by selecting the ellipses (**...**) at the top right of the Viva Insights app, selecting **Settings**, then selecting **Protect time** from the left pane. You can confirm or change any of the quiet-time options or turn quiet time off at any time.

# Reflect in Viva Insights

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app to become more aware of how you're feeling. This awareness can benefit both your productivity and your wellbeing. In fact, research has shown that even the act of taking a moment to reflect has positive benefits for wellbeing.

>[!Important]
>Performing self-reflection by selecting the available emojis is an entirely private action. No one else can see what you chose.

## Reflect

You can choose your own frequency for self-reflection. Once daily might work well for you &mdash; or more often than that, or less often.  

1. On the Viva Insights Home page, locate the **How are you feeling?** card.

   ![Screenshot that shows Reflect icons.](images/reflect-card.png)

2. Select the emoji that best represents how you're currently feeling. The card gives you feedback to acknowledge your choice. <!--determine whether this is the final look of the feedback card-->

   ![Screenshot that shows the Feedback page.](images/reflect-nice.png)

3. (Optional) Select **Reflection history** to see how your feelings have changed over time, as indicated by the emojis you've chosen. For example:

   ![Screenshot that shows reminders to reflect.](images/reflect-graph.png)  

4. (Optional) Set a reminder to practice reflection. Go to [Set a reminder to self-reflect](#set-a-reminder-to-self-reflect).

## Set a reminder to self-reflect

Remind yourself to self-reflect in the future.

>[!Note]
>
>* You can schedule reflection reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.
>* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You cannot set different times for different days of the week.
>* The reminder might not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but most reminders appear within five minutes before their scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could appear between 4:55 and 5:00.
>* Scheduled reflection reminders can expire. If you select a reflection reminder for a previous day or time, you will see a message that the reminder has expired.
>* You can reflect at any time on the Home page or the virtual commute page. Reflection that you do on those pages is independent of any reminders that you have set for reflection.

You can set reminders to reflect either on the [**Settings** page](viva-teams-app-settings.md) or the **Home** page, as described here:

1. On the **Build a habit of emotional awareness!** card, select a day and time:

   ![Screenshot that shows Reflect reminders.](images/reflect-reminder.png)  

2. Select **Set reminders**.

   On the day and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to self-reflect.

  Selecting the reminder notification opens the Reflect feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Reflect](#reflect).
