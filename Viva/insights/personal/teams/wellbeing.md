Use the **Wellbeing** tab in Microsoft Viva Insights to understand your work habits, manage your team better, and promote a healthy balance between life and work.

>[!Note]
> If you're a leader or manager, you'll see an additional section at the top of your Wellbeing tab. Make sure to check out the [For leaders and managers](#for-leaders-and-managers) section later in this article.

Here's what you can do in **Wellbeing**:

* Start plans to [focus](../use/focus-plan.md), [learn, take breaks, and catch up on messages](wellbeing-plans.md).

* [Book impromptu focus sessions and enter a distraction-free focus mode](focus.md).

* Prep for tomorrow and end your day mindfully with a [virtual commute](virtual-commute.md).

* [Reflect](reflect.md) on how you're feeling.

* Set up after-hours [quiet time](quiet-time.md) and keep track of how well you're keeping that time work-free.

* Start a [guided meditation with Headspace](headspace.md).

* Read wellbeing-related articles.

## About the tab

In the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll notice three main sections (plus more if you're a manager or leader): **Take action to improve your wellbeing**, **Track your progress**, and **Act with intention**. 

### Take action to improve your wellbeing

The **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section helps you change habits, schedule your time, and disconnect from work when the day's over. Here, you can pick from the following options:

* Start a daily focus plan
* Start a shared focus plan
* Make time for messages
* Schedule virtual commute reminders
* Schedule emails for later
* Disconnect with quiet time
* Take a break or two
* Make time for learning
* Make time for lunch
* Plan your time away

Let's say your calendar is filling up with meetings and you're finding it hard to carve out time to focus. You think that some dedicated focus time on your calendar might help. On the **Start a daily focus plan** card, you select **Set daily focus plan**. Viva Insights guides you through a quick setup process to find out which times work best, then schedules that time on your calendar each day.

### Track your progress

After you set up an action, Viva Insights tells you how that action is going in **Track your progress**. For the focus plan you set up earlier, Viva Insights shows you stats about how much time you kept on your calendar for focusing in the last couple of months, and also reports how much time you have reserved for the coming week.

If you need to make changes to your focus plan or another action you've taken, use the **Change settings** link.

### Act with intention

The **Act with intention** section is your home base for wellbeing content. Switch between themes using the **Focus**, **Meditation**, and **Articles** buttons. 

Under:

* **Focus**, start a [focus session](focus.md#start-a-focus-session), [book focus time](focus.md#book-single-non-recurring-focus-sessions), and listen to focus music.
* **Meditation**, start [guided meditations from Headspace](headspace.md) or do a breathing exercise.
* **Articles**, access articles about wellbeing from the [Inspiration library](inspiration.md).

## For leaders and managers

On the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization's capacity for focused work and work-life balance.

Each day, an insight related to one of the following topics appears at the top of your **Wellbeing** tab:

* Uninterrupted focus hours 
* After hours collaboration 
* No meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours 
* Focus time participation 
* Focus time impact 
* No meeting day participation


On the insight card, view the current week's average measure, the difference from the prior period's average, and the measure's 12-week trend.

If you want more information about the insight, including a comparison to peer organizations (for eligible users), a breakdown by team, a percentage distribution, and calculation methods, select **Show details** on the insight card.

To help your team improve their meeting effectiveness, Viva Insights shows you a recommended actionâ€”for example, starting a shared focus plan. Select the action button, like **Set up plan**, either on the insight card on the **Wellbeing** tab, or from within the insight details page. Viva Insights then takes you through the feature setup process.

You can also access shared actions in your **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section. Start a [shared focus plan](shared-focus-plan.md) or a [shared no-meeting day](shared-no-meeting-day.md).
