# Wellbeing
	
Use the **Wellbeing** tab in Microsoft Viva Insights to understand your work habits, manage your team better, and promote a healthy balance between life and work. Start booking time to focus, do a guided meditation with Headspace, read up on wellbeing topics, and more. In this article, we'll explain where and how to access these resources.

## About the tab

In the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll notice a header with the option to enter [focus mode](focus.md#start-a-focus-session) or complete a [virtual commute](virtual-commute.md).

>[!Note]
> If you're a leader or manager, you'll see an additional section at the top of your Wellbeing tab. Make sure to check out the [For leaders and managers](#for-leaders-and-managers) section later in this article.


Scroll down, and you'll find three main sections: **Take action to improve your wellbeing**, **Track your progress**, and **Act with intention**. 

### Take action to improve your wellbeing

The **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section helps you change habits, schedule your time, and disconnect from work when the day's over. Here, you can pick from the following options:

* Start a daily focus plan
* Start a shared focus plan
* Make time for messages
* Schedule virtual commute reminders
* Schedule emails for later
* Disconnect with quiet time
* Take a break or two
* Make time for learning
* Make time for lunch
* Plan your time away

>[!Tip]
>To find all available actions, use the arrows in the top-right of the section.

Let's say your weeks are filling up with meetings and you're finding it hard to carve out time to focus. You think that some dedicated focus time on your calendar might help. On the **Start a daily focus plan** card, select **Set daily focus plan**. Viva Insights guides you through a quick setup process to find out which times work best, then schedules that time on your calendar each day.

Learn more about focusing with Viva Insights in [Focus](focus.md).

### Track your progress

After you set up an action, Viva Insights tells you how well it's going in **Track your progress**. For the focus plan you set up in our earlier example, Viva Insights provides stats about how much time you kept on your calendar for focusing in the last couple of months, and also reports how much time you have reserved for the coming week.

>[!Tip]
>If you need to make changes to your focus plan or another action you've taken, use the **Change settings** link.

### Act with intention

The **Act with intention** section is your home base for wellbeing content. Switch between topics using the **Focus**, **Meditation**, and **Articles** buttons. 

:::image type="content" source="./images/wellbeing-act-intention.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Act with intention, Meditation section with four guided meditation videos users can play.":::

Under:

* **Focus**, start a [focus session](focus.md#start-a-focus-session), [book focus time](focus.md#book-single-non-recurring-focus-sessions), and listen to focus music.
* **Meditation**, start [guided meditations from Headspace](headspace.md) or do a breathing exercise.
* **Articles**, access articles about wellbeing from the [Inspiration library](inspiration.md).

## For leaders and managers

On the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization's capacity for focused work and work-life balance.

Each day, an insight related to one of the following topics appears at the top of your **Wellbeing** tab:

* Uninterrupted focus hours 
* After hours collaboration 
* No meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours 
* Focus time participation 
* Focus time impact 
* No meeting day participation

On the insight card, view the current week's average measure, the difference from the prior period's average, and the measure's 12-week trend.

If you want more information about the insight, including a comparison to peer organizations (for eligible users), a breakdown by team, a percentage distribution, and calculation methods, select **Show details** on the insight card.

To help your team improve their meeting effectiveness, Viva Insights shows you a recommended actionâ€”for example, starting a shared focus plan. Select the action button, like **Set up plan**, either on the insight card on the **Wellbeing** tab, or from within the insight details page. Viva Insights then takes you through the feature setup process.

You can also access shared actions in your **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section. Start a [shared focus plan](shared-focus-plan.md) or a [shared no-meeting day](shared-no-meeting-day.md).
