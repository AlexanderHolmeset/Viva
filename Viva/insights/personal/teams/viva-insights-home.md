# Home in Viva Insights

In Microsoft Teams, select **Insights** (left app bar) to open the **Home** page for the Microsoft Viva Insights app:

![Home (morning)](images/home-page-with-headspace.png)

The Home page makes it easy to start the other Viva Insights features. You can reach some features on the top menu and others within the Home page.

## On the top menu

When you select a feature on the top menu, you leave the Home page.

* [Stay connected](viva-insights-stay-connected.md)
* [Protect time](viva-insights-protect-time.md)

## On the Home page

You use the following features without leaving the Home page. Just follow the on-screen instructions.  

* [Up-next card](#up-next-card) - View the card and its message.
* [Reflect](viva-insights-reflect.md) &ndash; Under **How are you feeling?**, select a representative image. <!--In the following cases, you can take action directly on a feature's card on the Home page without needing to open the feature.  -->
* Send [Praise](viva-insights-praise.md) &ndash; Under **Send praise to your colleagues**, select **Send praise**.
* [Guided meditations from Headspace](#take-a-break) &ndash; In the **Headspace** card, select the 'Play' button. (Alternatively, you can select from among **More mindfulness exercises**.)
* [Take a break](#take-a-break) &ndash; Under **Take a break**, select **Start**. 

> [!NOTE]
> As of June 2021, Headspace is only available to users who have their language in Teams set to English. (Additional languages will be supported soon.) The **Take a break** option is available to those who do not have their default language set to English.  

For the next three cards, you can take a quick action while remaining on the Home page. Alternatively, you can open the full feature (and leave the Home page) by selecting another option on the card &ndash; such as **More insights**.

* [Stay connected](viva-insights-stay-connected.md) &ndash; Follow up on the action that the **Stay connected** card currently shows. For example, book a 1:1 with a particular person.
* [Protect time](viva-insights-protect-time.md) &ndash; Take the action that the **Protect time** card currently shows. For example, book focus time for tomorrow. 
* [Microsoft To Do](#microsoft-to-do) &ndash; Take action on the task in your **To Do** list that the card currently shows. For example, book a meeting.

## Up-next card

On the Home page, the card in the upper left alerts you in various ways. It changes its appearance and message depending on the time of day and the events in your calendar. For example, if your lunchtime (as configured in MyAnalytics) is approaching, it lets you know how soon:

<!-- THE LINK IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH NEEDS TO GO HERE. NOTE THE ANCHOR: configured in MyAnalytics](../WorkplaceAnalytics/personal/Use/use-the-insights.md#set-lunch-hours) WHICH REPLACED https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/personal/use/use-the-insights#set-lunch-hours -->

![Lunch approaching.](images/lunch-break.png)

The card's color changes to alert you of other events, such as scheduled focus time, meetings, and even the switch from morning to afternoon and the approach of the end of your scheduled workday or [Virtual commute]():

## Mindfulness content from Headspace

This feature offers a curated set of guided meditations and focus music from Headspace. For more information, see [Headspace](viva-insights-headspace.md).

## Take a break

This feature offers a one-minute "breathing break" animated experience that you can use as often as you want during your workday. To start it, select **Start**. 

## Microsoft To Do

This card shows tasks that are in your **To Do** list that are due today or for which a reminder for today has been set. Select **All To Do tasks for today** to open the Tasks app in Teams. For more information, see [Microsoft To Do](https://to-do.microsoft.com/tasks/).
