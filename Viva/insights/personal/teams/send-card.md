# Send a card in Viva Insights

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams to send your colleagues a message celebrating an occasion, such as a birthday or a holiday.

Use the **Send a card** feature to maintain positive relationships and connect with your colleagues in a fun way. You can send a card from nine different categories in Teams as either a 1:1 chat or in a Teams channel.

You'll see recommendations on cards you can send to these colleagues who you [closely collaborate with](../use/network.md) or have pinned as [important](../use/network.md#important-people). Viva Insights uses your collaboration activity (email, meetings, calls, and chats) to identify the people you closely collaborate with.

You can also share your birthday with Viva Insights, so your colleagues will know when to send you a birthday card. You can also customize the card with a personal message and select how it is sent.

If you subscribe to notifications, you'll get a notification in your activity feed in Teams on the day of an event with card recommendations. You can select what time of day you want to be notified about these recommendations.

## Send a card

1. On the **Home** page, select the **Send a card to your colleagues** card in the **Activities for you** section:

3. In **Customize your card**, enter an optional personal message, and then select where you want to send it, either as a **1:1 chat** or in a **Teams channel**.

4. Select **Preview**, and then you can select **Edit** to make any necessary changes, **Cancel** to cancel the card, or **Send** to send it.
5. You'll see a message about the card being sent with an option to **Dismiss** the card if you want to cancel it.

## Share special dates

In this section of Send a card, you can share your birthday by selecting the **Month** and **Date**, and then select **Save**. Viva Insights will remind your team to wish you a happy birthday close to your birthday.

You can also select **Skip** to not share your birthday. Or if you change your mind about sharing your birthday, select the **ellipsis** sign > **Settings** in Viva Insights to add, edit, or delete your birthday information at any time.

## Notifications

In this section of Send a card, you can set to be notified when occasions occur, so you can send a card for the occasion and connect with your colleagues.

If you want to get these notifications, select the time of day you want to be notified, and then select **Subscribe**. The time you select applies to notifications for each day of the week. You cannot set different times for different days of the week.

The notification might not arrive exactly at the scheduled time, but within 15 minutes on either side of it. For example, for a 5 PM notification, youâ€™ll see it sometime between 4:45 and 5:15 PM.

You can change your set notification time by selecting the **ellipsis** sign > **Settings** in Viva Insights.
