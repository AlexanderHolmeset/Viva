# Send a card in Viva Insights

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams to recognize the contributions of your employees and co-workers. Praise messages are shown as notifications in Microsoft Teams. You can have a praise message delivered in a private chat, or for wider recognition, in a Teams channel conversation.

You can also set reminders to send acclaim on a regular basis to your coworkers. See [Set a praise reminder](#set-praise-reminders).

>[!Note]
>The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).

## Send a card

1. On the Home page, select the **Send praise to your colleagues** card, which is located on the **Home** page at center left:
