# Send a card in Viva Insights

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams to send your colleagues a message celebrating an occasion, such as a birthday or an anniversary.

Use the Send a card feature to maintain positive relationships and connect with your colleagues in a fun way. You can send a card from nine different categories in Teams as either a 1:1 chat or a Teams chat.

Within You'll see recommendations for the colleagues you closely collaborate with or have pinned as an important contact in Viva Insights. You can also share your birthday with the system, so your colleagues will know when to send you a birthday card.

If you subscribe to notifications, you'll get a notification in your activity feed in Teams on the day of an event with card recommendations. You can then select when to be notified to send a card. You can also customize the card with a personal message and select when and how it is sent.
