**Suggested tasks** includes the following insights:

* [Identify and pin important collaborators](#identify-and-pin-important-collaborators)  
* [Stay on top of outstanding task suggestions](#stay-on-top-of-outstanding-task-suggestions) 
* [@Mentions for pinned important contacts](#-for-pinned-important-contacts) 
* [Upcoming meetings that need your RSVP](#upcoming-meetings-that-need-your-rsvp) 
 
#### Identify and pin important collaborators  

You might receive insights from various people but some items might deserve more attention than others. For example, an outstanding task suggestion from your manager or a message from a key customer would likely be of higher priority.  

Based on your collaboration patterns, you can pin some of your contacts as important. All insights from pinned important contacts are shown with higher priority at the top of the page.  

To pin a contact, select the **pin** icon on the bottom left below the contactâ€™s name:

To unpin a contact, select the **unpin** icon:

#### @Mentions for pinned important contacts 


@Mention is a common way to tag colleagues on important work items. Microsoft Viva Insights can help you quickly triage recent @Mentions from pinned contacts so that you are caught up on important conversations and tasks in Teams. In the following example, select **Go to comment** to open the conversation and follow up.

#### Upcoming meetings that need your RSVP 

Letting your colleagues know if you can join their meeting helps them run more effective meetings. When they have meeting attendance information, meeting organizers can better plan and prepare for meetings, and reschedule them if they need to. 

Select the **RSVP** button to **Accept** or **Decline** the meeting invitation. You can also select the meeting name for more information about the event.
