# Suggested tasks

Use **Suggested tasks** in the Microsoft Viva Insights app to stay connected with your collaborators and improve your productivity.

:::image type="content" source="images/productivity-suggested-tasks.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Suggested tasks page." :::

**Suggested tasks** includes the following insights:

* [Identify and pin important collaborators](#identify-and-pin-important-collaborators)  
* [Stay on top of outstanding task suggestions](#stay-on-top-of-outstanding-task-suggestions) 
* [@Mentions for pinned important contacts](#-for-pinned-important-contacts)
* [Upcoming meetings that need your RSVP](#upcoming-meetings-that-need-your-rsvp)
 
## Identify and pin important collaborators  

You might receive insights from various people but some items might deserve more attention than others. For example, an outstanding task suggestion from your manager or a message from a key customer would likely be of higher priority.  

Based on your collaboration patterns, you can pin some of your contacts as important. All insights from pinned important contacts are shown with higher priority at the top of the page.  

To pin a contact, select the **pin** icon on the bottom left below the contact’s name:

To unpin a contact, select the **unpin** icon:

## Stay on top of outstanding task suggestions

It's easy to lose track of commitments you've made to your colleagues over email. This insight helps you make sure that nothing falls through the cracks by reminding you of tasks you've agreed to do. It is based on emails that you've sent and requests from your colleagues during the last 14 days of email communication, and includes:

Commitments – Something that you promised or committed to do for someone else in an email
Requests – Something that another person asked you to do in an email
Follow-ups – Something that you asked for from someone else in an email
In the following example, you can select Re: Sync up on Regression Tests to open the email in which you can follow up or select Done to confirm that you’ve already followed up.

This insight is available in the languages listed in Briefing languages.

## Catch up on unread documents shared with you

Searching for that document you planned to read but just can't find it? With so many documents shared across meetings and emails, it can be difficult to stay caught up on documents shared by your colleagues. With this insight, you'll get recommended shared OneDrive and SharePoint documents you might need to catch up on.

When Viva Insights suggests catching up on an unread document, select **Open** to read it.

## @Mentions for pinned important contacts 

@Mention is a common way to tag colleagues on important work items. Microsoft Viva Insights can help you quickly triage recent @Mentions from pinned contacts so that you are caught up on important conversations and tasks in Teams. In the following example, select **Go to comment** to open the conversation and follow up.

## Upcoming meetings that need your RSVP 

Letting your colleagues know if you can join their meeting helps them run more effective meetings. When they have meeting attendance information, meeting organizers can better plan and prepare for meetings, and reschedule them if they need to. 

Select the **RSVP** button to **Accept** or **Decline** the meeting invitation. You can also select the meeting name for more information about the event.
