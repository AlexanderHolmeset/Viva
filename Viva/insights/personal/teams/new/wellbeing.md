>[!Note]
> If you're a leader or manager, you'll see an additional section at the top of your Wellbeing tab. Make sure to check out the [For leaders and managers](#for-leaders-and-managers) section later in this article.

Here's what you can do in **Wellbeing**:

* Start plans to [focus](../use/focus-plan.md), [learn, take breaks, and catch up on messages](wellbeing-plans.md).

* [Book impromptu focus sessions and enter a distraction-free focus mode](focus.md).


* Prep for tomorrow and end your day mindfully with a [virtual commute](virtual-commute.md).


* [Reflect](reflect.md) on how you're feeling.


* Set up after-hours [quiet time](quiet-time.md) and keep track of how well you're keeping that time work-free.


* Start a [guided meditation with Headspace](headspace.md).


* Read wellbeing-related articles.


## For leaders and managers

On the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization's capacity for focused work and work-life balance.

Each day, an insight related to one of the following topics appears at the top of your **Wellbeing** tab:

* Uninterrupted focus hours 
* After hours collaboration 
* No meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours 
* Focus time participation 
* Focus time impact 
* No meeting day participation


On the insight card, view the current week's average measure, the difference from the prior period's average, and the measure's 12-week trend.

To help your team improve their meeting effectiveness, Viva Insights shows you a recommended actionâ€”for example, starting a shared focus plan. Select the action button, like **Set up plan**, either on the insight card on the **Wellbeing** tab, or from within the insight details page. Viva Insights then takes you through the feature setup process.
