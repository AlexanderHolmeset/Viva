# Network

Use the **Network** page in Microsoft Viva Insights to understand who you collaborate most with and when. On this page, you'll find:

* Suggested important contacts, along with tips to improve connections with existing important contacts.
* A map view of your top collaborators, which you provides details about the important people in your network.

You can get to the **Network** page from your **Teamwork** tab in the Viva Insights app in Teams and web. Under the **Build better relationships** section, in the **Time spent collaborating with others** card, select **View my network**.

## Important people  

Important people are teammates and colleagues you mark as important in Viva Insights. Marking people as important (or "pinning" them) helps you keep up with their requests in **Suggested tasks** and find them quickly on your collaboration map, which we talk about below.

### To edit your important people list

You can add someone to your important people list in a couple of ways:

* At the top of your **Network** page, you might notice they're a suggested contact. To add them to your important list, just select the **Pin** icon, which looks like a star.
* If the person you want to pin isn't suggested, use the search bar just above your collaborator map. Type in their name, and then select **Pin**.

To remove someone from your important people list, do the reverse: select the **Pin** icon, which looks like a star. To quickly find a contact, use the search bar.

## About the metrics  

Top collaborators are based on your meetings, email, chats, and calls. If you hold a meeting with or exchange email, chats, or calls with coworkers, they are considered collaborators.  

An active collaborator is a coworker you collaborated with in the past four weeks, whereas total collaborators uses activity over the past year.  

An important collaborator is a coworker who you selected as important in Viva Insights.  

Total time is an estimation of the number of hours you spent in meetings, email, chats, and calls with that person in the last four weeks (both during and outside of your working hours).

Make time for networking: Making time to foster relationships and grow your network has proven to contribute to professional advancement. A team partner study showed a correlation between successful salespeople and large networks. The top salespeople boasted internal networks that were 33% larger than those who performed below average. In this case, an investment in meaningful coworker relationships translated to higher performance
