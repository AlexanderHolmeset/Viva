# 1:1 meeting plan

*Applies to: users with a premium subscription. Refer to the note below.*

As a people manager with a busy schedule, you know how hard it can be to keep up with your direct reports. That’s why we built the 1:1 plan—to help you connect regularly with your team.

## How the 1:1 plan works

1:1 meeting plans find time that work for both you and your team member, then book recurring meetings during that time at the frequency you pick. The day before your scheduled 1:1, both you and your team member get a notification from Viva Insights. This notification prompts you to cancel or reschedule any meetings that conflict with your 1:1 time, and it also invites you to add top-of-mind topics to the 1:1 meeting chat. During your 1:1, you'll be able to access those topics through the chat window.

>[!Note]
>This feature is premium, but because it’s in a preview state, participants don’t require a premium subscription to join the plan. This requirement is subject to change.

## For plan organizers

### To set up a 1:1 meeting plan

On the **Teamwork** tab within the Viva Insights app, you’ll find a card prompting you to start a 1:1 meeting plan. Select **Set up 1:1 plan** to get started.

   Screenshot of the "Manage time with your team" section in the Teamwork tab. On the left, there's a "Set up a 1:1 plan with your direct reports" window with three descriptions: "Get reminders to prepare for 1:1s," "Share meeting topics to stay productive," and "Resolve any meeting conflicts." A button is highlighted which reads, "Set up 1:1 plan." On the right, there's a window of a table with four rows and four columns. Each row is for one employee. Column one is "Name (8)" with each employees' name. Column two and three are "Last 1:1" and "Next 1:1" with a date, time, duration, and recurring icon, except for row 1, which shows "Not scheduled." Column 4 is "Schedule," which has a calendar-icon button on each row. Beneath the "Name" column, there's a "Show more" link, and beneath the "Schedule" column, there's an "Is this helpful?" label with "Yes" and "No" links.

The app then shows you table with this information:

* List of your direct reports

    >[!Note]
    >Viva Insights determines your direct reports based on your company’s organizational data. For more information, refer to Team insights FAQ.

* Proposed meeting time based on your availabilities
* Meeting frequency, with **Weekly** as the default
* **Status** column, which indicates whether the individual is enrolled in the plan
* **Actions** column, where you can edit the plan at any time

Review the information in the table to make sure you have all the right participants and time slots. If you don’t see someone in the list who you want to add to your plan, find them through the **Add a person to invite** search bar.

When you’re ready to get your 1:1s started, select the checkmark next to each participant, and then select **Invite**. Team members get an invitation in Outlook for a recurring meeting. After participants accept the invite, they’re enrolled in the 1:1 plan.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-invite.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 1:1 meeting plan invitation screen.":::
   Screenshot of the 1:1 plan setup screen. The title is "1:1 meeting plan" with an information icon to the right. The subtitle reads, "A 1:1 plan sets up a meeting series with team members and helps you prepare in advance, shrae meeting topics, and clear your calendar in one place." A search bar with the placeholder text, "Add a person to invite," is beneath the subtitle. To the right of the search bar, there's an "Invite" button. In the middle of the image, there's a table with five columns. Column one is "Name," with each employee's name. Column two is "Proposed time," with an information icon; this column shows a dropdown menu for each employee with a proposed weekday and time duration, except for the last row, which already has a meeting scheduled. Column three is "Frequency"; each row has a dropdown menu that reads, "Weekly," except for the last row, which is already scheduled. Column four is "Status"; all rows read, "Not invited." Column five is "Actions," which has an ellipses for each row. Each row has a blue checkmark selected, including the header row.
:::image-end:::

If a recurring 1:1 meeting series already exists for any direct report, the plan will include that series as part of the experience.
 
After you send your invitations, the **Status** column shows “Invitation sent.” When invitees accept the invitation, the status changes to "Invited."

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-invited.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 1:1 meeting plan invitation screen reflecting that participants have been invited.":::
   Screenshot of the 1:1 plan setup screen with the same structure as the prior image, except for a few differences. The Status column shows a green checkmark icon and the word "Invited" for each listed participant. The "Frequency" column now shows "Weekly" for all particpants and no longer has a dropdown. A green banner at the top of the image contains a green checkmark and reads, "Invited for people to plan" with a "What's next?" button. No rows have their checkmark selected.

### To edit or end a 1:1 meeting plan

#### Edit meeting times

To edit the time you meet with a participant, select the ellipses (**...**) under **Actions**, and then select **Edit meeting series**. The plan automatically suggests times that work for both you and your team member. You can also specify a custom day and time for your 1:1 series.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-edit-mtg.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the edit menu for a 1:1 plan participant.":::
   Screenshot that shows just one row of the prior 1:1 plan setup table as described in the prior image. The user has hovered over the ellipses in the "Action" column, which brought up a two-option menu: "Edit meeting series" and "Remove person."
:::image-end:::

The plan automatically suggests times that work for both you and your team member. Use the dropdown menu beneath the meeting title to pick available times. When you're ready to send the invitation, select **Invite**.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-edit-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Edit 1:1 meeting series window.":::
   Screenshot of the "Edit 1:1 meeting series" window. The subtitle is "Meeting series details" and there's an X in the top-right corner of the image. The window has five sections, arranged vertically; plan organizers can edit sections two through five. The first section shows the plan invitee's profile image and name. The second section shows the meeting series title. The third section shows the meeting day, date, and time in a dropdown-menu format. The fourth section shows the frequency in a dropdown-menu format and the end date, which is optional, with a date picker. The fifth section is a text input field with the placeholder text, "Encourage your team to accept and set this team norm." There are two buttons at bottom right: "Cancel" and "Invite."
:::image-end:::

#### End a plan

To end a 1:1 plan with a specific team member, select the ellipses (**...**) under **Actions**, and then select **Remove person**. After you confirm that you want to remove them, the plan automatically removes this person from the setup table and cancels the active 1:1 series.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-remove-and-confirm1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows removing a person from a 1:1 plan and confirming their removal.":::
   Screenshot of the single row of the "Edit 1:1 series table," described in an earlier image, with "Remove person" highlighted on the "Actions" menu. A descriptive arrow points downward to the resulting screen, which is a confirmation window. The text's title reads, "Remove this person?" and the paragraph beneath says, "Removing Henrietta Mueller from the 1:1 meeting plan will cancel your meeting series with them, but you can always add them to the plan again later." There are two buttons at bottom right: "Cancel" and "Remove person."
:::image-end:::

 To end all your 1:1s, you'll need to remove each person separately.

## For plan invitees

When your manager invites you to a 1:1 plan, you'll receive an Outlook meeting series invitation. To join the plan, select **Accept**. Viva Insights then adds a recurring 1:1 meeting on your calendar.

## For all participants

### To prepare for your 1:1 meeting

The day before your 1:1, Viva Insights sends the organizer and the invitee a Teams notification. Select **Next** on this notification.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-teams-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 1:1 meeting notification in Teams.":::
   Screenshot of the Teams interface, including a notifications panel on the left side of the image and a notification image on the larger, right panel. A notification at the top of the notifications panel is titled, "Prepare for your 1:1 meeting" and the subtitle says, "Review calendar and add meeting topics." On the right panel, a square window shows a notification titled, "Prepare for your upcoming 1:1" with the subtitle, "You have one 1:1 meeting tomorrow, Tue, Oct 4." Beneath the subtitle, there are two profile images next to text that says, "10:00 AM (25) minutes" and a green icon symbolizing that the meeting recurs. In the bottom left of the window, a link says, "Change notification settings." In the bottom right of the window, there are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Next."Users will also find a "Back" link to the left.
:::image-end:::

The app then shows you a list of your calendar events that conflict with the 1:1. Cancel or reschedule those events here, then select **Next**.

:::image type="complex" source="../images/1-1-plan-conflict1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the meeting preparation process.":::
   Screenshot of the "Resolve meeting conflicts" pane, which is the next step of the meeting preparation process. The subtitle says, "These meetings conflict with your next 1:1 meetings:" and there's an X in the top right corner. Beneath the subtitle, there's a meeting listed in a box on the left side of the pane. On the right side of the pane, the meeting title is listed, along with its time, duration, and a "Decline" button beneath. The section below is titled, "Who you're meeting with" and provides several profile pictures. The next section below is titled, "Organizer" and shows a profile image and name. There are two buttons in the bottom right of the pane: "Cancel" and "Next." Users will also find a "Back" link to the left.
:::image-end:::

In the last step, the app encourages you to add talking points to the meeting chat. When you start your 1:1, you’ll find what you entered here in the meeting’s chat window.

The subheader says, "Both participants can add and view meeting opics for this meeting." Below the subheader, there's a text box with three added meeting topics. In the bottom left, there's a "Back" link with the partipant's name. In the bottom right, there are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Next."
