# Viva Insights Home

In Microsoft Teams, select **Insights** (left app bar) to open the **Home** page for the Microsoft Viva Insights app. You can also open a web-based Viva Insights at [insights.viva.office.com](https://insights.viva.office.com), or through the Microsoft 365 App Launcher menu at [office.com](https://www.office.com).

![Screenshot that shows the Viva Insights Home page.](images/app-home-ic2.png)

The Home page makes it easy to start the other Viva Insights features. You can reach some features on the top menu and others within the Home page.

## On the top menu

When you select a feature on the top menu, you'll leave the Home page.

* [Stay connected](viva-insights-stay-connected.md)
* [Protect time](viva-insights-protect-time.md)
* [Inspiration library](inspiration.md)

## On the Home page

You use the following features on the Home page with the on-screen instructions.  

* [Up-next card](#up-next-card) – View the card and its message.
* [Reflect](viva-insights-reflect.md) – In **How are you feeling?**, select a representative image. <!--In the following cases, you can take action directly on a feature's card on the Home page without needing to open the feature.  -->
* Send [Praise](viva-insights-praise.md) – In **Send praise to your colleagues**, select **Send praise**.
* [Guided meditations from Headspace](#take-a-break) – In the **Headspace** card, select the **Play** button. (Alternatively, you can select from among **More mindfulness exercises**.)
* [Take a break](#take-a-break) – In **Take a break**, select **Start**.

>[!NOTE]
>Headspace is only available if you have your language is set to English in Teams. Additional languages will be supported soon. However, the **Take a break** option is available even if you don't have your default language set to English.

For the next three cards, you can take a quick action while remaining on the Home page. Alternatively, you can open the full feature (and leave the Home page) by selecting another option on the card &ndash; such as **More insights**.

* [Stay connected](viva-insights-stay-connected.md) – Follow up on an action shown in **Stay connected**, such as to book a 1:1 with a specific person.
* [Protect time](viva-insights-protect-time.md) – Take action on what's shown in **Protect time**, such as to book focus time for tomorrow.
* [Inspiration library](inspiration.md) – See inspirational articles within specific themes, such as wellbeing, culture, impact, and resilience.
* [Microsoft To Do](#microsoft-to-do) – Take action on what's shown in your **To Do** list, such as to book a meeting.

## Up-next card

On the Home page, the top card shown in the upper left alerts you in various ways based on the time of day and the events in your calendar. For example, if your lunch time (as configured in [the Outlook add-in](../use/use-the-insights.md#set-lunch-hours)) is approaching, the **Up-next** card will let you know how soon:

![Lunch approaching.](images/lunch-break.png)

The card's color changes to alert you of other events, such as scheduled focus time, meetings, the switch from morning to afternoon, and for the end of your scheduled workday or [Virtual commute](viva-insights-virtual-commute.md):

![Virtual commute.](images/virtual-commute.png)

## Mindfulness content from Headspace

This feature offers a curated set of guided meditations and focus music from Headspace.

>The Headspace experience is available to you if your language in Teams is set to English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish.

Viva Insights has introduced a curated set of guided meditations and Focus music from Headspace. Reach these resources on the [Home](viva-insights-home.md) page to help you start your day grounded, relax your mind before a big presentation, find focus before starting an important project, or close out your day with a mindfulness exercise during your virtual commute. In just a few minutes a day, meditation and mindfulness with Headspace can help you decrease stress and increase focus.

This card shows tasks that are in your **To Do** list that are due today or for which a reminder for today has been set. Select **All To Do tasks for today** to open the Tasks app in Teams. For more information, see [Microsoft To Do](https://to-do.microsoft.com/tasks/).


## Praise in Viva Insights

Use praise in the Microsoft Viva Insights app to recognize the contributions of your employees and coworkers. Praise messages are shown as notifications in Teams. You can have a praise message delivered in a private chat, or for wider recognition, in a Teams channel conversation.

You can also set reminders to send acclaim on a regular basis to your coworkers and view your praise history. See [Set a praise reminder](#set-praise-reminders) and [Praise history](#praise-history) for details.

>[!Note]
>The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams that you can access in the Viva Insights app. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).


### Send praise

To send praise, open the praise feature in one of the following ways:

#### Send praise from the Teams content pane using the praise messaging extension

To use the Teams messaging extension:

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select **Praise**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/content-pane-select-praise1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Praise icon.":::

   (If the praise feature doesn't appear, follow the steps in [Find the Praise feature](#find-the-praise-feature).)

1. When the praise composer opens, the **Title** defaults to **Awesome**. If you want to send a different title with your praise message, select a new one.

1. If you’re in a group chat or channel, add the name of the person you want to praise. In a 1:1 chat, the name defaults to the other person in the chat.

1. (Optional) Select a **Background** color for your praise message.

1. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note of up to 500 characters.

1. (Optional) Select **Preview**.

### Set praise reminders

Remind yourself to send praise to coworkers. Praise reminders are always recurring; this helps you build the habit of letting coworkers know that you appreciate their contribution.

>[!Note]
>
>* You can schedule praise reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.
>* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You can't set different times for different days of the week.
>* The reminder might not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but most reminders appear within five minutes before their scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could appear between 4:55 and 5:00.

You can set praise reminders either from the **Home** page or the **Settings** page:

From the **Home** page:

1. On the **Send praise to your colleagues** card, select the **Send praise** button.
1. On the **Praise** page, configure your reminder through the card on the right.
   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-reminder4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise reminder on the Praise page.":::

From the **Settings** page:

1. Select the ellipses (**...**) at the top of any page, then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Praise** from the left pane.
1. In the praise reminder settings, move the **Reminder** toggle to **On**, then select the time of day and day of the week you want to be reminded.

   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-set-reminder-in-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise reminder settings on the Settings page.":::

   On the day of the week and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to send praise. Selecting the reminder notification opens the Praise feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Send praise from the Viva Insights Home page](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page).

## Praise history

>[!Note]
>Praise history is only available for users with Exchange Online mailboxes. Mailboxes hosted on-premises aren't supported. For more details about plans, refer to our [FAQ](../overview/Mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is).

To find a history of all the praise messages you've sent and received over the last six months, select **View history** at the bottom of your praise feed.

:::image type="content" source="images/praise-view-history3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise history.":::

This history includes the message's title and text, sender and receiver, and date sent. View the original praise in the Teams chat by selecting **Go to message**.

You can also access your personal praise history by selecting **Review your praise history** in the **Praise** section that shows within your Teams channel **Posts**. This link only shows you your own personal history that nobody else can see.


## Praise recommendations

On the right section of the praise page, you'll see praise recommendations for your top collaborators. Recommendations provide pre-populated suggestions to send praise based on signals such as collaboration activity. If you're a manager, the app recommends team members you haven't praised in a while. To start your message, select the **Start praise** button.

## Praise trends

Praise trends is available to you if you have a Viva Insights subscription. Use this section to see analytics about your praise messages, like praise sent and received counts, your biggest fans, and top praises received. Only you can see this information.
