# Viva Insights Home

Use Viva Insights **Home** to discover key wellbeing, productivity, and teamwork insights and actions. Here, we highlight insights and actions that give you the most value in the flow of work. You'll find these sections on your **Home** tab:

* Recommended for you
* Your progress
* Inspiration library

If you're an organizational leader, meaning you're assigned the Insights Business Leader role or your admin has enabled group manager access for you, you'll also find an **Insights for your organization** section at the top of your **Home** tab.
