# Praise in Viva Insights

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams to recognize the contributions of your employees and coworkers. Praise messages are shown as notifications in Teams. You can have a praise message delivered in a private chat, or for wider recognition, in a Teams channel conversation.

You can also set reminders to send acclaim on a regular basis to your coworkers and view your praise history. See [Set a praise reminder](#set-praise-reminders) and [Praise history](#praise-history) for details.

>[!Note]
>The **Praise** app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).

## Send praise

To send praise, open the praise feature in one of the following ways:

* The Viva Insights [Home](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page) page
* The [content pane](#send-praise-from-the-teams-content-pane-using-the-praise-messaging-extension) of Teams

### Send praise from the Viva Insights Home page

1. On the Home page, select **Send praise** button on the **Send praise to your colleagues** card, which is located on the **Home** page at center left.

2. When the Praise page opens, the badge defaults to **Awesome**. If you’d like to send a different badge with your praise message, select a new choice.

3. Add the name of the person you want to praise.

4. Choose the visibility of this praise. To make this choice, you first need to decide whether you want to keep the praise private between you and the recipient or to make it visible (as a form of kudos, for example) to everyone in a Teams channel:

   * To make the praise message appear privately in a 1:1 chat between you and the recipient, select **1:1 chat**. This option is available only if you and the recipient have already participated in a Teams chat together. 

   * To let all the members of a Teams channel or subchannel see the praise message, select **Teams channel**. This option is available only if all of the praise recipients are participants in the Teams channel or subchannel that you choose.

5. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note.

6. (Optional) Select **Preview**.
   * Inspect your praise on the left panel. If you need to edit it, select **Edit**. Change the badge choice, the recipients list, or the personalized note.

7. When it's ready to go, select **Send**.

### Send praise from the Teams content pane using the Praise messaging extension

In Viva Insights, you can always send praise directly from the [**Home** page](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page), which does not require installing the Praise messaging extension.

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select **Praise**.

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting the Praise icon.](images/content-pane-select-praise1.png)

   (If the Praise feature doesn't appear, follow the steps in [Find the Praise feature](#find-the-praise-feature).)

2. When the **Praise** modal opens, the badge defaults to **Awesome**. If you want to send a different badge with your praise message, select a new choice.

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting a new badge.](images/praise-chat-select-new-badge.png)

3. If you’re in a group chat or channel, add the name of the person you want to praise. In a 1:1 chat, the name defaults to the other person in the chat.

4. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note of up to 500 characters.

5. (Optional) Select **Preview**.

6. When it's ready to go, select **Send**.

### Find the Praise feature

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select more options (the ellipsis):

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting the ellipsis.](images/type-new-msg1.png)

2. In the **Find an app** field, start typing "praise" and then select the **Praise** app to open it.  

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting the icon for the Praise app.](images/find-app-praise.png)

   The **Praise** app opens.

3. Continue with the steps in [Send praise from the Teams content pane using Praise messaging extension](#send-praise-from-the-teams-content-pane-using-the-praise-messaging-extension).

## Set praise reminders

Remind yourself to send praise to coworkers. Praise reminders are always recurring; this helps you build the habit of letting coworkers know that you appreciate their contribution.

>[!Note]
>
>* You can schedule praise reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.
>* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You can't set different times for different days of the week.
>* The reminder might not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but most reminders appear within five minutes before their scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could appear between 4:55 and 5:00.

You can set praise reminders either on the [**Settings** page](viva-teams-app-settings.md) or on the **Home** page, as described here:

1. Select the **Send praise to your colleagues** card, which is located on the **Home** page at center left.
2. In the praise reminder settings, select the time of day and day of the week, and then move the **Reminders** slider to **On**:

   ![Screenshot that shows setting a Praise reminder.](images/praise-settings-page.png)

   On the day of the week and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to send praise. Selecting the reminder notification opens the Praise feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Send praise from the Viva Insights Home page](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page).

## Praise history

>[!Note]
>Praise history is only available for users with Exchange Online mailboxes. Mailboxes hosted on-premises aren't supported. For more details about plans, refer to our [FAQ](../overview/Mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is).

In the **Looking back** section on the **Praise** page, you can see the history for as many as 24 messages that you have either sent or received over the last six months. This history includes any praise sent or received through this page and through the Teams messaging extension.

![Screenshot that shows Praise history.](images/praise-history.png)

This history includes related praise details, such as the type of badge, who the sender and receiver were, the date and time it was sent, and so on. You can also view the original praise in the Teams chat by selecting **Go to message** within the detailed view of the badge.

You can also access your personal praise history by selecting **Review your praise history** in the **Praise** section that shows within your Teams channel **Posts**. This link only shows you your own personal history that nobody else can see.

## Praise recommendations

At the top of the **Praise** page, you'll see praise recommendations for your top collaborators. If you're a manager, the app recommends team members you haven't praised in a while. To start your message, select the **Send praise** button.
