# 1:1 meeting plan

*Applies to: users with a premium subscription. Refer to the note below.*

As a people manager with a busy schedule, you know how hard it can be to keep up with your direct reports. That’s why we built the 1:1 plan—to help you connect regularly with your team.

## How the 1:1 plan works

1:1 meeting plans find time that work for both you and your team member, then book recurring meetings during that time at the frequency you pick. The day before your scheduled 1:1, both you and your team member get a notification from Viva Insights. This notification prompts you to cancel or reschedule any meetings that conflict with your 1:1 time, and it also invites you to add top-of-mind topics to the 1:1 meeting chat.

>[!Note]
>This feature is premium, but because it’s in a preview state, participants don’t require a premium subscription join the plan. This requirement is subject to change. 

## How to set up a 1:1 meeting plan

On the Teamwork page within the Viva Insights app, you’ll find card prompting you to start a 1:1 meeting plan. Select Set up 1:1 plan to get started.
 
The app then shows you table with a:

* List of your direct reports.

    >[!Note]
    Viva Insights determines your direct reports based on your company’s organizational data. For more information, refer to Team insights FAQ.

* Proposed meeting time based on your availabilities.
* Meeting frequency, with Weekly as the default.
* Status column, which indicates whether the individual is enrolled in the plan.
* Actions column, where you can edit the plan at any time.

Review the information in the table to make sure you have all the right participants and time slots. If you don’t see someone in the list who you want to add to your plan, find them through the Add new participant search bar.

When you’re ready to get your 1:1s started, select checkmark next to each participant, and then select Enroll. Team members get an invitation for a recurring Outlook meeting. After participants accept the invite, they’re enrolled into its 1:1 plan.

If a recurring 1:1 meeting series already exists for any direct report, the plan will include that series as part of the experience.
 
After you send your invitations, the Status column shows “Invitation sent.” When invitees accept the invitation, the status changes to “Enrolled.”
 
### To edit meeting times

To edit the time you meet with a participant, select the ellipses (…) under Actions, and then select Edit plan. The plan automatically suggests times that work for both you and your team member. 
 
## To prepare for your 1:1 meeting

The day before you and your team member are scheduled to meet, Viva Insights sends you both a notification to prepare for the 1:1. Select Next on this notification.

>[!Note]
>You can also edit your notification settings through this window. 

The app then shows you a list of your calendar events that conflict with the 1:1. Cancel or reschedule those events here.
  
Lastly, the app encourages you to add talking points to the meeting chat. When you start your 1:1, you’ll find what you entered here in the meeting’s chat window.
