# Inspiration library in Viva Insights

You can use the Inspiration library in Microsoft Viva Insights to learn more about the things that matter most to you. This library brings together thought leadership from industry experts that’s designed to inspire you in life and at work to get the most out of both.

You can use the library to help transform your personal, manager, and leader insights into actions. The articles are shown on the page within specific themes, such as wellbeing, culture, impact, and resilience. The article sources include Microsoft, Harvard Business Review, and Thrive Global.

## View an article

The library shows you articles that you haven’t read yet first. You can view these articles within your Teams app on your computer or mobile device. Select the **eye** (view) icon to focus in and view the complete story. For example, the following shows what you might see from Thrive Global. To view all the articles available to read within a specific theme, select **View more** in that section.

Viva Insights will show you more based on what you read and your feedback about them, such as selecting the **thumbs up** and **thumbs down** to confirm what you liked and disliked in the library.
