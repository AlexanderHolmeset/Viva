# Configure the app

Use the Settings page to configure the features for the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams. For example, you can turn reminders on or off, or change the day and hour settings for features on the Settings page, such as for [Praise](viva-insights-reflect.md) and [Reflection](viva-insights-reflect.md).

To configure the settings:

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select the **ellipsis** (...), and then select **Settings**:

   ![Select settings.](Images/upper-right-corner.png)

2. You can set the following settings:

   * **Workweek** - Edit the days of the week that you work, your start time, end time, and your time zone. These settings are kept synchronized with the same settings in [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance). That is, if you change them in one place, they will be updated everywhere that they appear.
   * **My team** - This option is available only to people who are recognized in Azure AD as managers. Initially this shows your team as it is listed in Azure AD. You can use this option to update the list of team members. However, after you edit your team members here, it will no longer synchronize with Azure AD.
   * **Set recurring reminders** - You can set recurring reminders for self-reflection, for sending praise, or for starting your virtual commute. You can schedule these reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.

   The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders; you cannot set different times for different days of the week. The reminder will not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but within 15 minutes on either side of it. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could show up anytime between 4:45 and 5:15.

   Each reminder shows up in your Teams activity feed. When you see it, you can select it there and it'll open the feature (reflection, praise, or virtual commute) directly in the Viva Insights app:  

      * **Reflection** - Edit the schedule for reminders to self-reflect. Change the days and time to receive reminders, and then select **Set reminders**.
      * **Praise** - Edit the schedule for praise reminders. Change the days and time to receive reminders, and then select **Set reminders**. 
      * **Virtual commute** - Choose the days on which you want to see the virtual-commute reminder and the time of day, and then select **Set reminders**.
