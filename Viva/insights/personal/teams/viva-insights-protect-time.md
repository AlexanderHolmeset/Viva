# Protect time

You can use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams to protect your time in the following ways:

* [Schedule focus time](#schedule-focus-time) for future workdays.
* [Start a virtual commute](viva-insights-virtual-commute.md) to end your day.

## Schedule focus time

Research shows that it can take an average of 23 minutes to refocus on a task after a distraction. Constant distractions during focused work can cause higher stress and lower productivity. Further, it is difficult to focus on challenging work when you only have small chunks of time available between meetings or are distracted by incoming emails and chats. Blocking a few hours every day to focus without interruptions will help you make progress on your important tasks and projects.

Microsoft Viva Insights can help you protect time for focused work and minimize notifications (and thus distraction) by Teams and Skype for business chats and calls during your focus time.

In the following example, select **Book Time** to reserve the time slot for focused work. If you donâ€™t need the time anymore, you can select **Remove slot** to free up your calendar. You can also select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to change the name of the focus time block, which automatically updates the subject of this focus-time booking on your calendar.
