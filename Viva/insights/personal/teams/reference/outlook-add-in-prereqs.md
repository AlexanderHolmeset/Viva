# Viva Insights Outlook add-in prerequisitres

Before you can use the Viva Insights Outlook add-in, you'll need to:

* Have an applicable Microsoft 365 plan and let at least 24 hours elapse since you were granted that license.
* Have a valid mailbox. This can't be a shared mailbox or even a shared mailbox that was converted into a user mailbox. It needs to be a user mailbox from the start. We recommended that you provision a new user mailbox, if necessary.
* Have the following in place:
    * Microsoft Outlook version 1705 (build 8201.2102) or higher for Windows, or version 15.39.1010 or later for Mac.
    * Add-in commands enabled for the Outlook add-in. For details, refer to [Add-in commands for Outlook](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-addin-commands).
    * Internet Explorer version 10 or 11 installed on your computer.

The admin enables the add-in by default in the Exchange admin center. If your admin sets the deployment status as "Optionally, disabled by default," you can manually add the Viva Insights Outlook add-in yourself from the Microsoft Store Add-ins.
