# Praise in Viva Insights

Use praise in the Microsoft Viva Insights app to recognize the contributions of your employees and coworkers. Praise messages are shown as notifications in Teams. You can have a praise message delivered in a private chat, or for wider recognition, in a Teams channel conversation.

You can also set reminders to send acclaim on a regular basis to your coworkers and view your praise history. See [Set a praise reminder](#set-praise-reminders) and [Praise history](#praise-history) for details.

>[!Note]
>The praise app is a messaging extension of Microsoft Teams that you can access in the Viva Insights app. For more information, see [Messaging extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).


## Send praise

To send praise, open the praise feature in one of the following ways:

* The Viva Insights [Home](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page) tab
* The [content pane](#send-praise-from-the-teams-content-pane-using-the-praise-messaging-extension) of Teams

### Send praise from the Viva Insights Home tab

1. Go to the **Recommended for you** section, find the **Send praise to colleagues** card, and select the **Send praise** button.

   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-send2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise on Home page.":::

1. When the praise page opens, add the name of the person you want to praise.

<!--Per Rachel, sharing will go out in January; LPC will go out in Feb-->

3. (Optional) Send a copy of this praise to someone else in your organization.

1. Choose the visibility of your praise—either just between you and the recipient, or to everyone in a Teams channel: 

   * To make the praise message appear privately in a 1:1 chat between you and the recipient, select **1:1 chat**. This option is available only if you and the recipient have already participated in a Teams chat together. 

   * To let all the members of a Teams channel or subchannel see the praise message, select **Teams channel**. This option is available only if all of the praise recipients are participants in the Teams channel or subchannel that you choose.

1. Pick a **Title**, or leave it at the default choice: **Awesome**.

1. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note.

1. (Optional) Select a new **Background** color for your praise message. 

1. (Optional) Select **Preview**.
   On the left panel, review what your praise message will look like. If you need to make any edits, select **Edit**. Change the title choice, the recipients list, or the personalized note.

1. When it's ready to go, select **Send**.

### Send praise from the Teams content pane using the praise messaging extension

In Viva Insights, you can always send praise directly from the [**Home** page](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page), which doesn't require installing the praise messaging extension.

To use the Teams messaging extension:

1. Below the **Type a new message** field, select **Praise**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/content-pane-select-praise2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Praise icon.":::

   (If the praise feature doesn't appear, follow the steps in [Find the Praise feature](#find-the-praise-feature).)

1. When the praise composer opens, the **Title** defaults to **Awesome**. If you want to send a different title with your praise message, select a new one.

1. If you’re in a group chat or channel, add the name of the person you want to praise. In a 1:1 chat, the name defaults to the other person in the chat.

1. (Optional) Select a **Background** color for your praise message.

1. (Optional) In the **Note** field, add a personalized note of up to 500 characters.

1. (Optional) Select **Preview**.

1. When it's ready to go, select **Send**.

### Praise feed

The praise feed shows your six most recent praise messages. To only see praise you've **Received**, praise you've **Sent**, or praise messages that other people have **Shared with you**, use the dropdown menu.

3. Continue with the steps in [Send praise from the Teams content pane using the praise messaging extension](#send-praise-from-the-teams-content-pane-using-the-praise-messaging-extension).

## Set praise reminders

Remind yourself to send praise to coworkers. Praise reminders are always recurring; this helps you build the habit of letting coworkers know that you appreciate their contribution.

>[!Note]
>
>* You can schedule praise reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.
>* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You can't set different times for different days of the week.
>* The reminder might not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but most reminders appear within five minutes before their scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could appear between 4:55 and 5:00.

You can set praise reminders either from the Viva Insights **Home** tab or **Settings** page:

From the **Home** tab:

1. On the **Send praise to colleagues** card, select the **All praises** link, which is to the right of the **Send praise** button.
   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-all-praises3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the All praises link to the right of the Send praise button.":::
1. On the **Praise** page, configure your reminder through the card on the right, beneath **Recommendations** and **Trends**.
   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-reminder4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise reminder on the Praise page.":::

From the **Settings** page:

>[!Note]
> Access the settings page by selecting the ellipses (**...**) at the top of any screen in the Viva Insights app, then selecting **Settings**.

1. Select **Praise** from the left pane.
1. In the praise reminder settings, move the **Reminder** toggle to **On**, then select the time of day and day of the week you want to be reminded.

   :::image type="content" source="images/praise-set-reminder-in-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise reminder settings on the Settings page.":::

   On the day of the week and time that you configured, the Viva Insights app will remind you to send praise. Selecting the reminder notification opens the Praise feature, after which you can continue with the steps in [Send praise from the Viva Insights Home page](#send-praise-from-the-viva-insights-home-page).

## Praise history

>[!Note]
>Praise history is only available for users with Exchange Online mailboxes. Mailboxes hosted on-premises aren't supported. For more details about plans, refer to our [FAQ](../overview/Mya-faq.md#q1-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is).

To find a history of all the praise messages you've sent and received over the last six months, select **View history** at the bottom of your praise feed.

:::image type="content" source="images/praise-view-history4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Praise history.":::

This history includes the message's title and text, sender and receiver, and date sent. View the original praise in the Teams chat by selecting **Go to message**.

You can also access your personal praise history by selecting **Review your praise history** in the **Praise** section that shows within your Teams channel **Posts**. This link only shows you your own personal history that nobody else can see.


## Praise recommendations

On the right section of the praise page, you'll see praise recommendations for your top collaborators. Recommendations provide pre-populated suggestions to send praise based on signals such as collaboration activity. If you're a manager, the app recommends team members you haven't praised in a while. To start your message, select the **Start praise** button.

## Praise trends

Praise trends is available to you if you have a Viva Insights subscription. Use this section to see analytics about your praise messages, like praise sent and received counts, your biggest fans, and top praises received. Only you can see this information.

## Praise highlights in the profile card

When you receive praise, the title and note will be visible on your profile card in Teams. People in your organization can view your praise details.
