When the Headspace feature is enabled, users can find it on the [Home](viva-insights-home.md) page of Viva Insights. Admins can disable this feature by using PowerShell cmdlets.

The PowerShell commands for working with Viva Insights features are described in [Set-VivaInsightsSettings](/powershell/module/exchange/set-vivainsightssettings). To disable Headspace, see [Example 1](/powershell/module/exchange/set-vivainsightssettings).
