# Create wellbeing plans

*Applies to: users with Viva Insights premium licenses*

In addition to focus plans, Viva Insights can also help you protect time on your calendar for scheduled breaks, learning, and message catch-up time. You can configure these plans to match your needs by setting a target amount of blocked time, and you can also personalize your booking preferences.  

You can create your plan in one of two ways: through the Viva Insights app or through the Briefing email you get on Fridays.

#### Through the Viva Insights app

To create a plan through the Viva Insights app, follow these steps:

1. Open the Viva Insights app, select the ellipses in the top-right corner of your screen, then select **Settings**.
