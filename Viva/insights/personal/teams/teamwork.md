# Teamwork

<!--from Shailendra-->

Teamwork is the hub for building and strengthening your connections with the team. The tab is organized by content that supports leaders, managers, and individuals. 

Leaders can understand whether teams in their organization are getting adequate Manager one-on-one time. The trends, peer comparison, and the ability to split by teams provider further richness to the insights. Further, they can also share specific insights with peers or managers within their team to initiate conversations and address specific concerns. Leaders can also empower Managers on their team by recommending the Effective 1-1 plan.

Managers can build a habit of conducting effective 1-1s with their team. The Effective 1-1 plan sets up a recurring 1-1 with team members while helping direct reports get the most of the 1-1 time with best practices embedded into the workflow. Automatic reminders on sharing topics and resolving conflicts creates space for both managers and direct reports to engage fully on an ongoing basis. Both the leader and manager value are premium content and require Viva Insights premium licenses.

For individuals, this section brings familiar content on network and collaboration habits from MyAnalytics. Individuals can get a quantitative picture of who they collaborate with and how they do it.  Observing patterns on quiet hours collaborations can help the individual tune it in ways that benefits them and their collaborators.
