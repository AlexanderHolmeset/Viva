# Personal insights language support

You can view the [Dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md) and [Viva Insights Home](../use/home-web.md) in the languages that are supported through your web browser. See [Browser support](#browser-support) for what's supported.

The personal insights with Viva Insights that are available through Outlook, such as [Digests](../use/email-digest-2.md) and the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md) support the languages available in Outlook. See [Change the time zone and language settings in Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-the-time-zone-and-language-settings-in-outlook-com-8a34d50d-81b4-40c2-b304-b3d043566389) to check or change your language setting. However, the [Task cards](../use/MyA-Outlook-add-in/MyA-Add-in-To-do.md) in the Viva Insights Outlook add-in are currently only available in English.

The [Viva Insights app in Teams](../teams/viva-teams-app.md) supports the languages available in Microsoft Teams. See [Change settings in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7) to check or change your language setting.

Also, see [Briefing languages](../briefing/be-languages.md) to see what's supported for Briefing emails.
