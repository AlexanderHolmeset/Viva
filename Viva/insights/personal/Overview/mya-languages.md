# Personal insights language support

The elements of Microsoft Viva Insights (including MyAnalytics) for personal insights, including the [Dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md), the [Digests](../use/email-digest-2.md), and the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md) are available in the following world languages. However, the [Task cards](../use/MyA-Outlook-add-in/MyA-Add-in-To-do.md) in the Viva Insights Outlook add-in are only available in English.

Also, see [Briefing languages](../briefing/be-languages.md) to see what's supported for Briefing emails.

This support is based on your Outlook language setting. For details, see [Change the time zone and language settings in Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-the-time-zone-and-language-settings-in-outlook-com-8a34d50d-81b4-40c2-b304-b3d043566389).
