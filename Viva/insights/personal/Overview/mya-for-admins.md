# Admin guide for personal insights

As an administrator, you benefit from knowing what Microsoft Viva Insights (formerly MyAnalytics) provides to its participants and what you can do to enable and enhance their experience.

## Benefits of use

Viva Insights can help participants strengthen their work relationships, have more time to focus on important work, and improve their work-life balance. Viva Insights does this by showing users insights about their work habits. It derives these insights from Microsoft 365 data about emails, meetings, calls, and chats. For more information, see [Why use Viva Insights](better-work-habits.md).

## You and your users are in charge

* As the admin, you control the configuration of how your users start using Viva Insights. See [Configure the dashboard](../setup/configure.md) for details.
* Users can opt in or out from the start. See [Opt out](../use/opt-out-of-mya.md) for details.
* Users can opt out of the personal dashboard. See [Opt out of the dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md#opt-out-of-the-dashboard) for details.
* Users can opt out of digests. See [Opt out of digests](../use/email-digest-2.md#opt-out-of-digests) for details.
* Users can opt out of the Insights Outlook add-in. See [Opt out of the Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md#opt-out-of-the-insights-outlook-add-in) for details.
* Users can opt out of inline suggestions. See [Opt out of inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md#opt-out-of-inline-suggestions) for details.

## Data privacy

None of a user's personal information is shared with their co-workers or managers. Viva Insights adheres to compliance regulations, such as the GDPR. Also see the [Privacy guide for admins](privacy-guide-admins.md).

## Granting access

Soon after you assign a license with the Microsoft Viva Insights (formerly MyAnalytics) service plan to a user, they'll get access to Viva Insights elements, such as the [Dashboard](../use/dashboard-2.md), [Digests](../use/email-digest-2.md), [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../use/mya-notifications.md), the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md), and the [Viva Insights welcome message](../use/mya-welcome-email.md).
Access to these elements depends on the plan in place at your organization; for details, see [Access to Viva Insights elements](plans-environments.md#access-to-myanalytics-elements).
