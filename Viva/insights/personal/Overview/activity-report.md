# Viva Insights activity

As a Microsoft 365 admin, the Reports dashboard in the admin center shows you an activity overview across the various products used by your organization. You can select an app to get more granular insights about the activities specific to it. Check out the activity reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

For example, you can evaluate the adoption of Microsoft Viva Insights by looking at the chart about active users. Additionally, you'll see a link to the deployment guide to further boost adoption in your organization.

## View the report

## Interpret the report

Your users’ Viva Insights activity is shown in the Active users’ chart. The chart shows the number of people using it and their usage trends for the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days.
