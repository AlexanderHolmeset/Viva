# Viva Insights trial

*This experience is only available through private preview*

The Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams helps people and businesses thrive with data-driven, privacy-protected insights, and recommendations for improving productivity and wellbeing.

As a licensed user with a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 plan, you can use this free 60-day trial to access insights to help build better work habits, such as following through on commitments made to collaborators and protecting focus time in the day for uninterrupted, individual work.

During your 60-day trial, you get access to premium features within the Viva Insights app. Your insights are based on information that you already have access to within Outlook and Teams. Viva Insights applies intelligence to this information to make it easier for you to reflect on work patterns and take action to improve yours and your team's productivity and wellbeing.

## Premium features

After you enroll in the trial, you can experience the following features within the [My team](../../use/myteam.md) page. These team insights are presented to you as a team lead or a manager, which are based on the team you define within the app.

* **Stay connected and engaged with your team**:  

  * Schedule 1:1 time with team members (or reschedule for a conflict). As a people manager or a team lead, it's likely that one of your many responsibilities is coaching team members to help them build the skills they need for their roles.
  * One of the simplest coaching tools that team leads or managers have are 1:1 time. Research by Microsoft has shown that people who get consistent 1:1 time with their manager and team members are more engaged. See [1:1 time in My team](../../use/myteam.md#11-time) for more details.

* **Team meeting habits**: Managers are role models when it comes to collaboration habits; team members tend to mimic their manager’s behavior. Studies found, for example, that managers who multitask in meetings (defined as reading or sending emails during a scheduled meeting) are more than two times as likely to have team members who also multitask in meetings. See [How 1:1 time is calculated](../../use/myteam.md#how-11-time-is-calculated) for details.
* **Send praise**: You can use this feature to recognize the contributions of your employees and coworkers. Praise messages show up as notifications in Microsoft Teams. You can have a praise message delivered in a private chat or for wider recognition, in a Teams channel conversation.
* **Stay on top of outstanding task suggestions**: It is easy to lose track of commitments made to your colleagues in email. This insight helps make sure nothing gets missed by reminding you. It's based on emails that you sent and requests you've made during the last 14 days of email communication, including the following. See [Stay on top of outstanding task suggestions](../teams/viva-insights-stay-connected.md#stay-on-top-of-outstanding-task-suggestions) for details.

  * **Commitments** – Something you promised or committed to do for someone else in an email.
  * **Requests** – Something another person asked you to do in an email.
  * **Follow-ups** – Something you asked someone else for in an email.

## Privacy

These premium features use real, live collaboration data from Microsoft 365 but use only your data for your insights – no private data is available from other users, even as de-identified or aggregated data. These insights are generated by using your data, such as your email, meetings, calls, and chats. Your individual employee data is stored and protected in the same way as your Microsoft 365 data.

As is the case with the full Microsoft 365 suite, Viva Insights helps support compliance with GDPR requirements. For more details, see the [Privacy guide](privacy-guide-users.md).

## Admin tasks

As the Viva Insights admin, you'll need to complete the following steps to give employees access to the trial experience.

* Identify the group of users in your organization who are already using the Viva Insights app in Teams. This experience is intended for managers and team leads, so those groups would be your ideal candidate.
* To test if the trial experience is discoverable, you can test it with a specific group. To do this, complete the following steps to enable that group access. Then you can ask if they see the banner prompting them to **Get started**, as described in the next section.

1. Use the following command in PowerShell to install this new version of Viva Insights:

   ```PowerShell
   Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 2.0.6-preview4 -AllowPrerelease
   ```

2. Use the following in PowerShell to connect with admin credentials:

   ```PowerShell
   Connect-ExchangeOnline
   ```

3. Complete the authentication as either a Global Administrator, Exchange Administrator, Teams Administrator, or Insights Administrator credentials.
4. Use the [Get-VivaInsightsSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-vivainsightssettings) and [Set-VivaInsightsSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-vivainsightssettings) commands in PowerShell, as required. For example:

   ```PowerShell
   Get-VivaInsightsSettings -Identity "testuser@tenant" -Feature discovertrybuy
   ```

   ```PowerShell
   Set-VivaInsightsSettings -Identity "testuser@tenant" -Feature discovertrybuy -Enabled $True
   ```

5. You'll also need to run [Set-VivaInsightsSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-vivainsightssettings) for each user who wants to opt out of this trial experience. For example:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-VivaInsightsSettings -Identity "testuser@tenant" -Feature discovertrybuy -Enabled $False
   ```

## Get started

After the admin tasks are complete, do the following to start your trial experience.

1. Within your Viva Insights app in Teams, select **Get started** when prompted to Support your team's wellbeing and productivity with even more Viva Insights features:

2. When prompted in **You've made a great choice**, select **Get started**.
3. In **Choose your team members**:

   * If you are a team lead or manager, enter, confirm, or remove the names of the people you want to include in your team insights, and then select **Confirm**.
   * If you are not a team lead, select **I don't lead a team** to skip this prompt.

4. For team leads and managers, you'll see team insights on the **My team** page. If you don't lead a team, you won't see the **My team** page.

## Expiration

During the trial experience, you'll see a prompt at the top of the page within Viva Insights in Teams that shows how many days you can use the trial experience. It'll then count down to show you how many days are left during this trial phase. It'll also prompt you to **Contact us** to complete a form and request a license to keep using these features after the trial ends.
