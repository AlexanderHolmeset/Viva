<!-- Note: In the topic that INCLUDEs this content, precede it with the following heading at the proper heading level:

## Requirements for analysts
-->

Before analysts can get to work, they must have the proper role. Each analyst must be assigned the Analyst role. An Azure Active Directory [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) assigns roles, and can learn more about this task in [Assign roles](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md). For general information about user roles for Viva Insights, see [Roles in Viva Insights](../use/user-roles.md).

**Licensing notes**

* To use the analyst features, you must have the [Analyst role](../use/user-roles.md#role-descriptions-and-access-levels) assigned.
* The predefined templates available in Query designer require the use of the Power BI desktop. You do not need a license for Power BI desktop; you can download it for free at [Getting started with Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/getting-started-with-power-bi/).
