| Nature of errors | Recommended selection | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Minor errors, small in number | Select **Edit mapping** | This displays the **Field Mapping** page, on which you can change how you map source-file fields to the attributes and then re-attempt validation. You can do this without changing and re-uploading the source file. This is best for minor errors such as having mapped the wrong column in the source file to a particular attribute. |
| Major errors | Select **Upload file** | This displays the first **File upload** page. Consider this option in the case of major errors in the originally uploaded data. First, edit the source-data file to fix those errors and then re-attempt the upload and validation process with the corrected file.|

### Guidelines for correcting errors in data

This section contains help for correcting data in an uploaded source file that is causing validation errors.

When any data row or column has an invalid value for any attribute, the entire upload will fail until the source file is fixed (or the mapping changes the validation type of the attribute in a way that makes the value valid).
