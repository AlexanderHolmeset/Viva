# Import organizational data from Workday

Your organizational data can appear in the Microsoft Viva Insightsâ€™ advanced insights app in one of four ways: 

* Through Azure Active Directory, which is the default source
* Through a .csv file that you as an Insights Administrator upload
* Through an automated data import that you, your source system admin, and your Microsoft 365 IT admin set up
* Through a connection between Workday and Viva Insights

This article talks about the fourth option: importing data through a Workday connection.
