| <a name="network-metrics-define"></a> **Network** | <a name="diverse-tie-score-define"></a> Diverse tie score | A numeric score that indicates how varied and how broad a person's connections are. This is based on both the infrequent direct collaboration between two people and on the differences in the common network they share between themselves. (Collaboration activities consist of emails, meetings, Teams calls, and Teams chats.) A person doesn't need to have much direct collaboration with their diverse ties, so it’s easy to have more diverse ties than strong ties. Diverse ties present good sources of fresh and varied information from across the company. | Score |
| | <a name="diverse-tie-type-define"></a> Diverse tie type | A value that indicates the relative diversity of the person's diverse ties. 0 means that the tie is not diverse; 1 means that the tie is diverse; 2 is an intermediate value that means more diverse than 0 but less diverse than 1. <!--(The Diverse tie type metric is derived from the Diverse tie score metric, which in turn is based on the thresholds that are described in The last columns give the results.)--> | Score |
| | <a name="diverse-ties-define"></a> Diverse ties | The number of diverse ties that a person has, that is, the number of ties whose Diverse tie type is 1. | Count |
| | <a name="influence-define"></a> Influence | A numeric score that indicates how well connected a person is within the company. A higher score means that the person is better connected and has greater potential to drive change. (A person’s connection score is based on the frequency of collaboration activities, which include emails, meetings, Teams calls, and Teams chats with other people within the company.) | Score |
| | <a name="influence-rank-define"></a> Influence rank | One of a sequence of numbers that starts with 1. A rank of 1 represents the person with the greatest Influence score; a rank of 2 represents the person with the next greatest Influence score, and so on. If two people have the same Influence score, they also have the same influence rank.| Score |
| | <a name="manager-overlapping-strong-ties-define"></a> Manager overlapping strong ties | The number of strong ties that are in common between a manager and their direct reports. If a manager shares a significant number of strong ties with their directs, this can indicate that they are on the same page and executing on a well known, well understood, common plan. This metric reflects the manager's ability to ensure that the team is working toward progress and team members are up to speed.| Count |
| | <a name="manager-unique-strong-ties-define"></a> Manager unique strong ties| The number of strong ties that are unique in the manager's network when contrasted with the strong ties of their direct reports. This metric helps answer the question: "What is the potential of this manager to bring fresh connections and fresh ideas to their team?" | Count |
| | <a name="strong-tie-score-define"></a> Strong tie score| A numeric score that indicates how strong and tight a person’s engagements are. It is based on both direct collaboration between two people and on the common network they share. (Collaboration activities consist of emails, meetings, Teams calls, and Teams chats.) For example, a "strong tie" between a manager and a direct report reflects both the amount of direct collaboration they have with each other and the time they both invest in connections that are common to both of them. Typically, a person has only a few strong ties because such ties take more effort to maintain.| Score |
| | <a name="strong-ties-define"></a> Strong ties| The number of strong ties that the person has; that is, the number of ties whose Strong tie type is 1.| Count |
| <a name="working-hours-collaboration-define"></a> **Working-hours collaboration** | <a name="working-hours-collaboration-hours-define"></a> Working-hours collaboration hours | Number of hours a person spent in meetings, emails, Teams chats, and Teams calls with at least one other person, either internal or external, after deduplication of time due to overlapping activities (for example, calls during a meeting), during working hours. | Hour |
| | <a name="working-hours-email-hours-define"></a> Working-hours email hours | Number of hours a person spent sending and receiving emails during working hours | Hour |
| | <a name="working-hours-call-hours-define"></a> Working-hours call hours | Number of hours a person spent in scheduled and unscheduled Teams calls, during working hours. | Hour |
| | <a name="working-hours-chat-hours-define"></a> Working-hours chat hours | Number of hours a person spent in Teams chats during working hours. | Hour |
| | <a name="working-hours-meeting-hours-define"></a> Working-hours meeting hours | Number of hours a person spent in meetings with at least one other person, during working hours. | Hour |
