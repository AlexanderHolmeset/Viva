# Errors

If you get an error in the Viva Insights app in Teams and web, or the advanced insights app, look through the solutions below. If you've tried these solutions and you're still getting errors, [contact our support team](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support#online-support) for help.

## Advanced insights app

### Signing in and setting up the advanced insights app

#### Oops! System is not yet ready to run queries... 

**Please check with Viva Insights Admin if at least 10 licenses have been assigned. If already done, then please wait until we get the system ready for running queries.**

##### Why am I getting this error?

Your setup may not have completed yet or your organization might not have enough licenses assigned.

##### What can I do to resolve it?

It takes a few days for Viva Insights to process Microsoft 365 collaboration data and for assigned users to get the right permissions. Most customers are able to access the app four to five days after the Insights admin assigns licenses.

Contact your Insights Administrator to confirm they've assigned enough licenses. They need to assign at least 10.

#### Oops! You haven't been assigned a role in Viva Insights yet...

**Please contact M365 admin for role assignment.**

##### Why am I getting this error?

You might get this error in the advanced insights app, usually on your first sign-in, for three reasons:

* Your Microsoft 365 global admin hasn't assigned you a Viva Insights license (that is, the ability to use the advanced insights app).
* Your Insights Administrator hasn't assigned you to a role that can access this page.
* If your organization uses Privileged Identity Management (PIM), you haven't activated your role yet.

##### What can I do to resolve it?

* Contact your Insights Administrator to confirm they've assigned you the right license and role. 
* Check whether your role has [permissions](../setup-maint/user-roles.md#feature-access) to access this page. 
* Activate your role in PIM.

#### Oops! Something's wrong and we can't find that page.

Refer to the information in [Oops! You haven't been assigned a role in Viva Insights yet...](#oops-you-havent-been-assigned-a-role-in-viva-insights-yet).

#### It looks like you don’t have access to this space... 

**Go to the new and enhanced Viva Insights platform for the most up-to-date experience.**


##### Why am I getting this error?

You'll get this error on the legacy Workplace Analytics app if you no longer have access to it.

##### What can I do to resolve it?

All customers are given a 90-day period to transition from the legacy Workplace Analytics app to the new advanced insights app. After this period, you'll see this error.

If you want to temporarily access the legacy Workplace Analytics app to retrieve data, contact our support team for help. If you’re only assigned [roles for our new platform](../setup-maint/user-roles.md), you’re not able to access the legacy app.

### Manager settings page

#### Manager settings can't be edited yet... 

**Please try again in a few days.**

[Pending]

##### Why am I getting this error?

You might get this error on the Manager settings page for two reasons:

* Data processing hasn't completed.
* You might not have the right prerequisites to access the **Manager settings** page.
* Fewer than 10 people in your organization have licenses.

##### What can I do to resolve it?

It takes a few days for Viva Insights to process Microsoft 365 collaboration data and for assigned users to get the right permissions. Most customers are able to access the app four to five days after the Insights admin assigns licenses.

If it's been four to five days:

* Review our documentation to make sure you have the right prerequisites to access **Manager settings**.
* Make sure at least 10 people in your organization have Viva Insights licenses assigned to them.

### Data upload

#### Oops! Something's wrong and we can't render this page right now...
