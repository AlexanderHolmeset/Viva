# Templates in Viva Insights

The Analyst pages in Viva Insights includes a number of predefined templates that analysts can use to visually analyze workplace patterns and trends. A template pre-populates a custom query and selects the applicable Power BI charts to show results from these queries.
<!--- "Analyst pages in Viva Insights" -- is this correct terminology? MD: How about pages for now? MS Style guide's preferences is try not to label UX unless it's necessary for navigation. this is not a tab,  Analyst is a left navigation section with multiple navigation options underneath it; a tab is typically used to separate two or more pages within a left navigation named page, we can discuss more when you're ready--->
<!--- Leaving out links for now --->

## Requirements for analysts

Before analysts can get to work, they need to have the proper role. Each analyst needs to be assigned the Analyst role in Viva Insights. An Azure Active Directory Application Administrator assigns roles, and can learn more about this task in Assign roles. For general information about user roles in Workplace Analytics, see User roles.

<!--- Is it still called "Azure Active Directory Application Administrator"? --->

<!--- Capitalizing "Analyst" -- correct? --->

## Licensing notes

To use analyst features, an employee needs only to have the Analyst role assigned. They don't need to have been assigned a Viva Insights license.

<!--- "an employee needs only to have the Analyst role assigned" -- "employee"? Also, this had "Workplace Analytics license." Are we using "Viva Insights license"?--->

The predefined templates available in the Analyst tab require the use of the Power BI desktop. You do not need a license for Power BI desktop; you can download it for free by going to Getting started with Power BI.

<!--- "They don't need to have been assigned a Workplace Analytics license." --->

## Power BI dashboards

The Analyze tab contains templates for the following Power BI dashboards for visually analyzing data in Power BI. Select one to see more details about it and to view an interactive demo.

>[!Note]
>Most of these dashboards are currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of Workplace Analytics. Before running the required queries, confirm or change the browser language to 'en-us' in the app's URL: 'https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/en-us/Home/' (Business continuity and Microsoft Teams insights are the exceptions that support the same languages as Workplace Analytics.)

<!--- Need to insert future demos here --->
