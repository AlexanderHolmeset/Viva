3. Under **Query setup**:
    1. Type a **Query name**.
    1. Select a **Time period**. **Time period** defaults to **Last 3 months**.
    1. Optional: You can set the query to automatically update by checking the **Auto-refresh** box. When you select the **Auto-refresh** option, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people.

    >[!Note]
    >If the organizational data used in an auto-refreshing query changes (for example, an attribute name is altered or an attribute is removed), you might see an error when you run the query.


    4. Optional: Type a **Description**.
    
        Selecting **More settings** brings you to a pane, but there’s nothing you need to change there. In this pane:

        * Power BI queries are set to **Group by Week**. You can't edit this field.
        * The **Metric rules** field defaults to **Meeting exclusions rule (preferred rule)**. This field isn’t customizable in this release; for more information, refer to [Metric rules](../../metric-rules.md).
