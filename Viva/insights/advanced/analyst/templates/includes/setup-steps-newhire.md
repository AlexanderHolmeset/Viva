    1. Type a **Query name**.
    1. Select a **Time period**. **Time period** defaults to **Last 3 months**.
    1. Set **Auto-refresh** (optional). You can set the query to automatically update by checking the **Auto-refresh** box. When you select the **Auto-refresh** option, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people.
        >[!Note]
        >If organizational data used in an auto-refreshing query changes (for example, an attribute name is altered or an attribute is removed), the query might stop auto-refreshing.
     4. Type a **Description** (optional).   
     5. Change the metric rule (optional). To set a new metric rule, select **More settings**. Then, pick a new rule from the list. For more information about metric rules, refer to [Metric rules](../../metric-rules.md). 
        >[!Note]
        >The **More settings** pane also contains **Group by** settings. Power BI queries are set to **Group by Week**, and you're not able to edit this field.

 1. Under **Predefined template metrics**, view a list of preselected metrics, which appear as gray tags. These metrics are required to set up the Power BI report and you canâ€™t remove them. However, you can add other metrics. 
     1. Customize your keywords (optional). This query uses a set of keywords within the **Calendared learning time** metric to determine training-related events. If you want to customize these keywords, you'll need to create a new metric now. Go to the [To customize your keywords](../new-hire-onboarding.md#to-customize-your-keywords) section for detailed steps on creating a new custom metric. Then, return here to complete the query process.
