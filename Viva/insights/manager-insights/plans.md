# Workplace Analytics plans for managers

By combining the capabilities of Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics, plans can help you transform insights from Workplace Analytics into targeted change plans across your team. The following targeted change plans are available for reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance, among other goals.

* **Focus** - Help team members get more time to do deep work and reclaim their calendar for work that matters most.
* **Collaboration** - Help team members reduce the number of excess meetings that the group schedules.
* **Wellbeing** - Help team members unwind and protect their personal time by disconnecting in their off hours.

> [!Note]
> Plans are not available within the Microsoft Viva Insights app.

You can do the following with plans:

1. [Launch a plan](#launch-a-plan) for the identified group, who experience the plan through [MyAnalytics](../personal/mya-landing-page.md).
2. [Manage and track a plan's progress](#manage-and-track-plans) while it is underway, and the ROI of the plan after it ends.

## Launch a plan

1. In an applicable insight, such as **After-hours**, **Long and Large meetings**, or **Focus Insights**, select **View recommended plan**.
2. If prompted, select **Validate** to confirm the team meets the minimum group size.
3. Optionally, you can select the **Edit** (pencil) icon next to **Plan name**, **Plan duration**, and **Plan target** to change the details for this plan.
4. Select **Create plan** to start the selected plan. Or you can select **Save as draft** to start the plan at a later date. The following shows an example Collaboration plan.

## Manage and track plans

In **Plans** > **Manage**, you can select to view **Drafts**, **Active**, or **Completed** plans. You can then:

* Delete or edit draft plans.
* Track or end active plans.
* Delete or track completed plans.

In **Plans** > **Track** > **Progress for**, you can select an active or a completed plan to measure progress of a target goal or ROI for the plan.

## Plan participants' experience

The actual work of change is done by your team through MyAnalytics. The group or team who you are included in a plan have the opportunity to change workplace habits for the better.

During a plan, these participants receive or can view the following items.

### MyAnalytics dashboard

The [MyAnalytics dashboard](../personal/use/dashboard-2.md) is a constantly available resource for MyAnalytics users. In addition to its standard content, the dashboard also includes a new participant section during a plan. This section contains information such as recommended habits and the participant's progress against the plan goals, similar to the following:

### Digest

All MyAnalytics users receive a weekly [digest](../personal/use/email-digest-2.md). In addition to its standard content, their digest for participants also includes a section that summarizes their progress in the plan, similar to the following:

### MyAnalytics inline suggestions

MyAnalytics inline suggestions in Outlook are brief, data- and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask whether you want to review them.

### Inline suggestions

Some inline suggestion apply only to participants of an active plan. For example, the Improve wellbeing suggestion applies only to participants in an active Wellbeing plan. The remaining suggestions in the following table are available to all MyAnalytics users in your organization, whether they are participating in an active plan or not.

| Inline suggestion | Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| ------ |------ |-------|---------|
|Improve wellbeing  |Reading pane (meeting invitation)   | Looks like this meeting is outside your typical working hours. Here are some alternate times that work for everyone. **See suggested times**  | Suggests that you ask the organizer to move the meeting to a time during working hours that works for all attendees. |
