# Viva Insights plans

The Viva Insights plans help you transform insights from Viva Insights into targeted change plans across your organization. Targeted change plans are available for reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance, among other goals. By using the plans feature, you can, for example:  

1. Use the advanced insights app to identify groups whose workplace effectiveness could be improved. For example, they might be experiencing excessive meeting load, lack of focus time, or lack of work-life balance.

2. Set up 12-week plans for the identified groups. The members of the group experience the plan through the [Dashboard](../personal/use/dashboard-2.md).

3. Measure the progress of the plan while it is underway, and the ROI of the plan after it has finished.

   >[!Note]
   >Plans are intended for use by analysts or program managers. For general information about roles, see [User roles in Viva Insights](../use/user-roles.md).

## Plans FAQ

### Roles and access

**Q1:** Why don't I see the **Plans** page?

**A1:** You can see the **Plans** page only if you've been assigned the role of analyst, limited analyst, or program manager.

**Q2:** What can people with the various Viva Insights roles do when they work with plans?

**A2:** People with the analyst and limited analyst roles have full write access to _all_ functionality of plans. Program managers have access to everything in plans except the **Identify** page.

All roles -- analysts of both levels or program managers -- can upload a .csv file of potential plan participants. (Also see the following question.)

Additional information about roles and access:

* For more information about roles in Viva Insights, see [User roles in Viva Insights](../use/user-roles.md).

* For more information about assigning roles, see [Assign roles](/viva/insights/setup/set-up-workplace-analytics?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#setup-steps).

### Plan implementation

**Q1:** Can we change the duration of the plans?

**A1:** Plans are scheduled to last twelve weeks. However, after you've started a plan, you can end it at any time.

**Q2:** What is the minimum group size?

**A2:** In **Analyst settings** > **Privacy**, admins can set the [minimum group size](../use/privacy-settings.md) for an organization or tenant, which can be greater than or equal to the absolute limit of **5** (five people).

In **Leader and manager settings** > **Manager settings**, admins can also set a [Minimum team size](../use/manager-settings.md) for people managers, which is different than the overall minimum group size setting. The absolute limit for this team size setting is **10**, which applies to all managers.

**Q3:** Can I monitor metrics for specific users?

**A3:** No. Privacy considerations preclude the monitoring of behavior information about specific users.
