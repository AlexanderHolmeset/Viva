|Business question |Analysis |Metrics used |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
|How is employee collaboration changing? |As remote work becomes the new normal, using online communication tools for collaboration and teamwork will help people in your organization succeed. |**Collaboration hours per week by activity** - Total time employees spent in meetings, chats, and on email activity shown on average weekly. The hours include both internal and external hours. **Chats** are approximated as 30 seconds for each chat (sent and received). **Emails** are approximated as 5 minutes for a composed email, and 2.5 minutes for a read email. **Remote meetings and calls** include the durations of meetings an employee has on their calendar (not counting meeting time that overlaps). |
|Is the wellbeing of employees being protected? |Without a physical separation between office and home, personal demands and meetings during the workday increase. This means that more work is occurring outside of standard business hours, leading to longer workdays, which can lead to employee burnout and attrition. |**Collaboration hours by time of day** - After-hours work is the number of hours employees spend in meetings, chats, and on email outside of working hours. Working hours are based on the employees' Outlook calendar settings.|
|Are remote meetings effective? |As collaboration shifts from in-person to remote, increased meeting load can overwhelm employees and slow down decision making. Research shows that shorter meetings with fewer attendees promotes focus and faster decisions. |**Meeting length and attendee count** - Long meetings are those scheduled for more than an hour. Large meetings are those that involve more than 8 people.|
|Are employees able to create and share effectively while working remotely? |As communication and ideation shifts from in-person to online, people need to embrace online collaboration tools and knowledge-sharing solutions to exchange ideas and insights, get feedback, and stay informed. |**Number of readers, creators, and collaborators over time** - Content collaboration is defined as one person creating and sharing an Office file, and then at least one other person editing it. |
|Do employees feel a sense of belonging and inclusion at work? |Remote work can leave people feeling isolated.
