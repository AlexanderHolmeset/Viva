# Plan participants' experience

**Role** - A participant in a plan or a person who is using Viva Insights or MyAnalytics for personal insights

While analysts and program managers can create and manage Workplace Analytics plans as part of Microsoft Viva Insights, the actual work of change is done by people. People who are using Viva Insights or MyAnalytics can participate in a plan and use it as an opportunity to change their workplace habits for the better.

All plans are scheduled to start on a Sunday. As soon as the plan starts and through the duration of the plan, its participants will receive or can view what is described in the following sections.

<!-- THIS IS TURNED OFF FOR NOW (MAY 2019)
## Welcome email

As a program manager schedules a plan, they can choose to let participants receive an automatically generated [welcome email](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/welcome-msg-prog-partic.png) from Workplace Analytics. This one-time email explains the details of the plan: its sponsor, its duration, and its targets -- the habits that participants are expected to work on.  
-->

## Viva Insights

[Viva Insights in Teams](../personal/teams/viva-insights-home.md), [Viva Insights Home page](../personal/use/home-web.md), and the [Dashboard](../personal/use/dashboard-2.md) are available resources for plan participants. In addition to the standard content available to all, the dashboard also includes a new participant section during a plan.

When people are part of a plan, they'll see a new **Team Plans** in their dashboard for tracking their progress. This added section contains information, such as recommended habits and a report about their progress as compared to the plan goals.

## Digest

People who use Viva Insights or MyAnalytics get a monthly [digest](../personal/use/email-digests-3.md) that focuses on a different work pattern each week, including: Focus, Wellbeing, Network, and Collaboration. This weekly digest is _not_ affected by a participant's enrollment in a plan.

### Teams Plan section

For plan participants, their monthly digest includes an additional section, such as the _Teams Plan_ section. This section summarizes their progress in the plan over the preceding month.

## Inline suggestions

[Inline suggestions](../personal/Use/mya-notifications.md) are brief, data-driven and AI-driven notifications that show up in Outlook when reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask if you want to review them.

### Plan-only inline suggestions

Many inline suggestions are available to all participants (see [broadly available inline suggestions](#broadly-available-inline-suggestions)), but some apply only to participants of a particular Teamwork plan, such as the [Collaboration plan](#collaboration-plan) or the [Wellbeing plan](#wellbeing-plan):

#### Collaboration plan

Participants in the Collaboration plan might see the following inline suggestion<!--s-->.

| Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| :------ |-------|---------|
|Reading pane (meeting invitation) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Could this meeting be 45 minutes?
