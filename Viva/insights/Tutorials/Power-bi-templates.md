# Power BI tips, FAQ, and troubleshooting

The following provides a few key Power BI tips, answers to some of the most frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting for the most common issues about setting up and using the Templates in Workplace Analytics.

## Power BI tips

A few tips to help you use these dashboards in Power BI:

* **Cross-filter and cross-highlight** - All visuals on a report page are interconnected. If you select a data point on one of the visuals, all the others on the page that contain that data will change, based on that selection.
* **Drill down into a visual that has a hierarchy** - When a visual has a hierarchy, you can drill down to reveal additional details. Some of the charts in the dashboards support this capability, such as the "By Organization and Level Designation" chart in the Business Continuity dashboard.
* **Export data as a table** – From the upper right corner of any visualization, select **More options** (**…**) and select **Export data**.

For more details about using Power BI, see [Interact with visuals in reports, dashboards, and apps](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-visualizations).

## Share a dashboard

Like other products that work with sensitive data, such as HR systems, Workplace Analytics is not meant for the general workforce. Rather, its users are expected to have training regarding how to handle sensitive information. Training should be specific to your organization. See [Data-protection considerations](../privacy/data-protection-considerations.md) when using data generated by Workplace Analytics.

Anyone you share the Power BI *desktop file* with can access the underlying dataset at the same level of granularity as a Workplace Analytics Analyst. For this reason, consider the following alternatives that do not provide access to the underlying data:

* **Share as a PDF or other static file** - This option generates a report that's not interactive. See [Export reports from Power BI to PDF](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-pdf).
* **Publish the report to Power BI Service and share insights in an app** - This option allows other users to navigate the dashboard without access to the underlying data. See [Distribute insights in an app](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports#distribute-insights-in-an-app) for details.

## FAQ

##### Q1 Who can create the dashboard in Power BI?

You must be assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics to create the dashboard. You must also have a Power BI license and have the desktop version installed. See [Install and run Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/desktop-getting-started#install-and-run-power-bi-desktop) for details.

##### Q2 How frequently is data refreshed in the dashboard?

The dashboard gets repopulated once a week after Workplace Analytics finishes its weekend processing. **Note**: You must manually adjust the **Selected time frame** setting in the dashboard's **Settings and scope** report to view the most recently processed data.

##### Q3 How do I share the dashboard with others in my organization?

You can share the dashboard with others in your organization *without sharing the underlying data* by publishing the insights in an app or as PDF or static file. See [Share a dashboard](#share-a-dashboard) for details.

##### Q4 Can I share the underlying dashboard dataset with others in my organization?

To maintain data privacy, only employees assigned the role of [Analyst](../use/user-roles.md) in Workplace Analytics should have access to the underlying dataset in the Power BI dashboard.

##### Q5 How do I know if I have the latest version of the template?

Starting with version 2 and later versions of a template, you can find the version number at the end of the title in the lower left of the dashboard’s Settings page.

##### Q6 How can I extend the dates of the data used in the dashboard?

If you have been using a dashboard for a few months now, you are probably using data for the last six months. You need to run new queries that include the last one year. For the Business continuity dashboard, see [Template update](../tutorials/power-bi-bc.md#template-update) for details.  

##### Q7 How do I set up the Workplace Analytics data?

See [Create a Person Query](./person-queries.md) for details.

##### Q8 How do I change the axis of a chart to use a different Organizational data attribute?

Only the required Organizational attributes are used when setting up the Power BI file. If you selected more Organizational attributes when setting up the queries, you can use those in the visuals. To use a different Organizational attribute:

1. Select the visualization you want to change.  
2. In the **Fields** pane, select and drag the Organizational attribute to the **Axis** section of the visualization.

##### Q9 How do I integrate additional metrics or data sources with this dashboard?

See [Connect to data in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/) to learn more about how to connect data in Power BI. See [Prepare organizational data](../setup/prepare-organizational-data.md) to learn about what organizational data you can analyze in Workplace Analytics and see [Data sources](../use/data-sourcesv2.md) to see what data sources you can connect to and analyze from within Workplace Analytics.

##### Q10 How do I use Power BI?

See [Power BI documentation](/power-bi/) for details on how to use Power BI.

##### Q11 What languages are the dashboards available in?

The dashboards are currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of Workplace Analytics. Before running the required queries, confirm or change the browser language to **en-us** in the app's URL: <https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/en-us/Home/>

## Troubleshooting

##### Unable to open document

If you get the following error, you do not have the latest version of Power BI.

  ![Unable to open error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/bcd-open-error.png)

However, the template might work with the earlier version of Power BI that you're using. To test it:  

1. Close any warnings.
2. If you can view the **Settings** page, the dashboard will work with this version. If you cannot view **Settings**, you need to download the latest version of Power BI.

##### Report layout differences might exist

If you get the following error, you do not have the latest version of Power BI. However, the template might work with this earlier version. To test it, repeat the steps in the previous section.

  ![Report layout error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/bcd-report-error.png)

##### OData request failed

The following error (or similar 500+ error) can occur for one of the following reasons.

  ![OData error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/bcd-odata-error.png)

* **If you were not prompted to sign in with your organizational account** while setting up the dashboard and Power BI fails to load the data, follow these steps to clear existing permissions:

  1. In Power BI, open the **Transform data** menu, and select **Data source settings**.
  2. Select **Global permissions**, select `https://workplaceanalytics.office.com`, and then select **Clear permissions**.
  3. Select **Delete**.
  4. Close Power BI and follow the set up instructions for the applicable dashboard.

* **If you are signed in with the wrong organizational account**, you'll get an error when loading the data with the template. To fix it, follow these steps:

  1. In Power BI, open the **Transform data** menu, and select **Data source settings**.
  2. Select **Global permissions**, select `https://workplaceanalytics.office.com`, and then select **Edit permissions**.
  3. For **Credentials**, select **Edit**.
  4. In the **OData feed** dialog box, select **Organizational account**, and then select **Sign in** or **Sign in as a different user**.
  5. Select the account that you use to sign in to Workplace Analytics, enter the password, and then when prompted in **OData feed**, select **Save**.
  6. In **Edit Permissions**, select **OK**, and then close the **Data source settings** window.
  7. Close Power BI and follow the set up instructions in **Set up the dashboard** for the applicable dashboard.

##### The Power BI visuals fail to load or show errors in the tables

Power BI cannot complete a data join if data values are missing in the Organization or Level Designation tables. To validate this error:

1. In the **Fields** pane in Power BI, look for an **error** (!) icon in either the **Organization** or **LevelDesignation** tables. If you see an error about blank values similar to the following, select the field with the error to view it.

   **Blank-value error** - Column in table contains blank values and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.

2. To remediate this error, select **Transform Data** > **Transform Data** to open the Power Query Editor.
3. Select the applicable results.
4. In the data preview table, locate the column for Organization and LevelDesignation, expand the column header, select **Remove Empty**, and then select **OK**.
5. Select **Hourly collaboration** and repeat **Steps 3-4** to filter out empty values.
6. Select **Close & Apply** to apply the changes and return to the dashboard.

##### Failed to save modifications error in Power BI

The following error occurs because of a preview features setting in Power BI. To change the setting for the dashboard, go to **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options** > **Preview features**. Clear the checkbox for preview features, and then save and restart the template.

  ![Preview features error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/pbi-preview-error.png)

##### OData error that the given URL neither points to an OData service or a feed in Power BI

When you publish this dashboard to workspaces, they get split into two parts, reports and datasets (data sources). This error occurs when your permission authentication token expires in Power BI. Do the following to reset permissions for the Power BI service.

1. Open your [Power BI service](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-experience#open-the-power-bi-service) (app.powerbi.com).
2. From **Home**, select the **ellipsis** (**...**) on the ribbon to view the menu, and then select **Settings** > **Settings**.

   ![Power BI Service Settings.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/pbi-service-settings.png)

3. Select **Datasets**, and then for the dashboard you're getting the error for, select the **ellipsis** (**...**) > **Settings**.
4. In **Data source credentials**, select **Edit credentials** for Workplace Analytics.
5. Select the account that you use to sign in to Workplace Analytics, enter the password, and then when prompted, select **Save**.

Do the following to reset your global permissions for the OData feed.

1. In Power BI, open the **Transform data** menu, and select **Data source settings**.
2. Select **Global permissions**, select `https://workplaceanalytics.office.com`, and then select **Edit permissions**.
3. For **Credentials**, select **Edit**.
4. In the **OData feed** dialog box, select **Organizational account**, and then select **Sign in** or **Sign in as a different user**.
5. Select the account that you use to sign in to Workplace Analytics, enter the password, and then when prompted in **OData feed**, select **Save**.
6. In **Edit Permissions**, select **OK**, and then close the **Data source settings** window.

##### Apply query error for blank values in columns

When setting up a report or refreshing an existing report for either the [Business continuity](power-bi-bc.md) or the [Ways of working assessment](power-bi-collab-assess.md) dashboards in Power BI, you might get the following Power BI error about the PersonIdDateKey column in a table containing "blank values," which is "not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table."

![Blank values error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/pbi-blank-error.png)

To resolve this error, you must download the template for the applicable data in **Query designer** > **Results** in Workplace Analytics, and then set up the template again in Power BI.

##### Collaborators record not found

If you get the following error, you have not selected the Organizational attribute that represents the employees' worksite location, such as the office or building for the Return to worksites dashboard.

![Collaborators record not found error.](../Images/WpA/Tutorials/pbi-collaborators-error.png)

Close Power BI, redo the set up steps in [Set up the dashboard for Return to worksites](power-bi-return-tw.md#set-up-the-dashboard), and then select the applicable Organizational attribute in **Steps 7 and 9** for the correct worksite location for the employees included in the analysis.
