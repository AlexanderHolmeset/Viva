# Team insights

*Applies to: people with a premium Viva Insights subscription and one or more people directly reporting to them*

Find insights and suggested actions based on your personal habits as a manager throughout the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web. In addition to providing information about how teams are built, this article gives a quick overview about insights you'll find in the following places:

* 1:1 information on the [Teamwork](../personal/teams/teamwork.md) tab
* Quiet hours impact on the [Wellbeing](../personal/teams/wellbeing.md) tab 
* Team meeting habits on the [Productivity](../personal/teams/productivity.md) tab

Throughout this document, we'll link you to where you can find more detailed information.

## About team data and data privacy

Team insights features use collaboration data from Microsoft 365 and—depending on your setup—uses organizational data that your admin has uploaded in the advanced insights app or that's presented in Azure Active Directory. All of this data is de-identified to maintain personal privacy in Viva Insights. Refer to [Data-protection considerations](../advanced/privacy/privacy.md) for more details. 

Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the same as for personal insights. For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in Viva Insights, refer to the [Privacy guide](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-privacy.md).

Team insights features are generated using each user's own data, which is computed from their email, meetings, calls, and chats. Individual employee data is stored and protected in the same way as the user's Microsoft 365 data. So, with team insights, you can't see individual team members' personal collaboration habits. 

## Permissions and app setup

### Admin tasks

Team insights and its features (as described on this page) are available users who have a [Viva Insights subscription with an applicable service plan](../personal/overview/plans-environments.md). Ask your admin about licensing and to install and set up the Viva Insights app for the organization. Refer to [Admin tasks](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md) for details.

## About teams

### How teams are built

Viva Insights automatically builds teams based on organizational data uploaded or connected to the advanced insights app. If your organization uses Azure Active Directory to populate Viva Insights—which is the default setting—then we use that directory’s information to build your team. If your admin uploads an HR file to the advanced insights app, then we use the information provided in that file to make your team, instead.

Your team only includes people reporting directly to you as presented in Azure Active Directory or the file your admin uploads. This structure means three things:

* To keep teams accurate, your organization needs to regularly update Azure Active Directory or upload new HR files.
* If you don’t have at least one person reporting directly to you, as presented in the organizational data file, you won’t have access to Team insights.
* Because teams come directly from organizational data, you’re not able to edit members. People who don't have direct reports won't be able to access team insights.

>[!Note]
>When your direct-reports list changes, your team meeting habits will reflect these changes in next week’s data.

## Available insights

### 1:1 time

As a people manager, it's likely that one of your many responsibilities is coaching team members to help them build the skills they need for their role. One of the simplest coaching tools you have at your disposal is 1:1 time. Research by Microsoft has shown that people who get consistent 1:1 time with their manager are more engaged and view the manager's leadership more favorably.

#### How 1:1 time is calculated

Any meeting on your calendar that includes only you and a team member counts as a 1:1. If the calendar invitation also has a meeting room assigned, it still counts as a 1:1.

If you directly call a team member over Teams outside of a scheduled 1:1 meeting, it doesn't count as 1:1 time.

### Team meeting habits

As a manager, you're a role model when it comes to collaboration habits, especially in meetings. Team members tend to mimic their manager's behavior. One study by Microsoft found, for example, that managers who multitask in meetings (defined as reading or sending emails during a scheduled meeting) are more than two times as likely to have team members who also multitask in meetings.

You'll find insights about your team meeting habits on the **Productivity** tab. Refer to [Meeting habits](../personal/teams/meeting-habits.md) to learn which habits we calculate and how we calculate them.

### Quiet hours impact

Some team members may prefer to do some of their work outside traditional 9-5 working hours, but others may struggle to mentally disconnect and recharge for the next day if they receive a late-night message from work.

Research by Microsoft has shown that when managers work after hours, team members take that as a signal that they need to be "on" too; in one study, every hour that people managers spent after hours translated to 20 minutes of additional direct report time spent after hours.

You'll find insights about quiet time impact on the **Wellbeing** tab. Learn how we calculate quiet hours impact in [Quiet time](../personal/teams/quiet-time.md).

### Shared plans

To create healthy team norms, you and your team might consider using shared plans. You can find and start [shared no-meeting day](../personal/teams/shared-no-meeting-day.md) and [focus](../personal/teams/shared-focus-plan.md) plans on the **Wellbeing** tab. To start a [shared meeting plan](../personal/teams/shared-meeting-plan.md), visit the **Productivity** tab. To set up regularly scheduled 1:1 meetings with your direct reports, check out [1:1 plans](../personal/teams/1-1-plan.md) on the **Teamwork** tab.
