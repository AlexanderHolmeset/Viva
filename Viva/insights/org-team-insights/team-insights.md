## About teams

### How teams are built

Viva Insights automatically builds teams based on organizational data uploaded or connected to the advanced insights app. If your organization uses Azure Active Directory to populate Viva Insights—which is the default setting—then we use that directory’s information to build your team. If your admin uploads an HR file to the advanced insights app, then we use the information provided in that file to make your team, instead.

Your team only includes people reporting directly to you as presented in Azure Active Directory or the file your admin uploads. This structure means three things:

To keep teams accurate, your organization needs to regularly update Azure Active Directory or upload new HR files.
If you don’t have at least one person reporting directly to you, as presented in the organizational data file, you won’t have access to Team insights.

Because teams come directly from organizational data, you’re not able to edit members.

>[!Note]

When your direct-reports list changes, your team meeting habits will reflect these changes in next week’s data.

### 1:1 time

As a team member, you often collaborate with other team members to get work done. However, with your own tasks and busy schedules, you might not feel you’re really staying in touch with each of your teammates. Dedicated 1:1 time can help.

As a people manager, it's likely that one of your many responsibilities is coaching team members to help them build the skills they need for their role. One of the simplest coaching tools you have at your disposal is 1:1 time. Research by Microsoft has shown that people who get consistent 1:1 time with their manager are more engaged and view the manager's leadership more favorably.

#### How 1:1 time is calculated

Any meeting on your calendar that includes only you and a team member counts as a 1:1. If the calendar invitation also has a meeting room assigned, it still counts as a 1:1.

If you directly call a team member over Teams outside of a scheduled 1:1 meeting, it doesn't count as 1:1 time.

### Team meeting habits

As a manager, you're a role model when it comes to collaboration habits, especially in meetings. Team members tend to mimic their manager's behavior. One study by Microsoft found, for example, that managers who multitask in meetings (defined as reading or sending emails during a scheduled meeting) are more than two times as likely to have team members who also multitask in meetings.

You'll find insights about your team meeting habits on the Productivity tab. Refer to Meeting habits to learn which habits we calculate and how we calculate them.

### Quiet hours impact

Some team members may prefer to do some of their work outside traditional 9-5 working hours, but others may struggle to mentally disconnect and recharge for the next day if they receive a late-night message from work.

Research by Microsoft has shown that when managers work after hours, team members take that as a signal that they need to be "on" too; in one study, every hour that people managers spent after hours translated to 20 minutes of additional direct report time spent after hours.

You'll find insights about quiet time impact on the Wellbeing tab. Learn how we calculate quiet hours impact in Quiet time.

### Shared plans

To create healthy team norms, you and your team might consider using shared plans. You can find and start shared no-meeting day and focus plans on the Wellbeing tab. To start a shared meeting plan, visit the Productivity tab.
