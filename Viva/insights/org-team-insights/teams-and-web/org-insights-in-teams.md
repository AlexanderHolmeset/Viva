# Organization insights in the Viva Insights app

Organization insights help leaders and managers of large teams understand how their organizations—the people who report to them directly or indirectly—are succeeding at work. Leaders and managers can see key indicators of their organization’s wellbeing, productivity, and team culture, and they can find features and tools to help support their teams.

Getting access

There are two ways for the Insights Administrator to grant access to organization insights:

•	They can assign a person to the Insights Business Leader role, or
•	They can enable a person as a Group Manager under Viva Insights Manager Settings

To be eligible to view organization insights, a person must have a premium Viva Insights license. Additionally, people in that person’s organization must also have a premium Viva Insights license for those people to be measured in an organizational insight. That means that for an Insights Business Leader to see an insight for their entire company, every person in their company must have a premium license.

People with the Insights Business Leader role can see organization insights that include every person in their tenant. People with the Group Manager role can see organization insights that only include people who report to them directly or indirectly. This reporting hierarchy is uploaded and maintained by the Insights Administrator. People with both the Insights Business Leader role and Group Manager role will be able to toggle between the two organization insights views.
