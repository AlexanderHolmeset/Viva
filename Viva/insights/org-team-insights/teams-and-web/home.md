# Home

For a general introduction to organization insights in the Microsoft Viva Insights app--including who can see organization insights and how to navigate them--refer to [Organization insights in the Viva Insights app](org-insights-in-teams.md). The following article talks about organization insights on the **Home** tab.

## Featured insights

Each day, you'll find a different featured insight on the **Home** tab, which draws from this list:

* Uninterrupted focus hours 
* Manager 1:1 meeting hours 
* Meeting hours 
* After-hours collaboration 
* No-meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours 
* Focus time participation 
* Join on-time rate 
* Focus time impact 
* No-meeting day participation
* Multitasking hours 
* Internal network size

Every insight shows the current week's average, and also shows the difference from the last week. 

To access other organization insight cards, select the **Show more** button.

## To share an insight

If you want to share a link to an insight you found on the **Home** tab, select the share icon on that insight's card. Pick whether you want to share the insight through a Teams chat or share a link to the insight card.

Sharing an insight through a Teams chat sends recipients a Teams chat message with a screenshot of the insight. You can edit the message before you send it.

Sharing an insight through a link sends recipients directly to the insight card on their own Home page. This method is more suited for people within the same organization who both have permissions to access organization insights. 

<!--could we put this in the FAQ? Seems like a bit too much info in this location/situation.

Sending a link doesn't grant anyone permissions to view data, so if recipients don't already have access to organization insights, they won't see anything new when they follow the link. -->
