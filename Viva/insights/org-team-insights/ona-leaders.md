# Insights for leaders

If you're assigned the **Insights Business Leader** role in Microsoft Viva Insights, you'll find some additional information on the **Organization trends** tab. Specifically, the following insights are available to you.

Download this [Power BI report](../Tutorials/power-bi-myorg.md) for a visualization of this information.

<!--this also goes to argo-->

## Improve team cohesion

Changes in work environments can leave employees feeling isolated from their colleagues. Feeling part of community is important for engagement and goal alignment as employees navigate change.

According to the [Rebuilding companies as communities](https://insights.office.com/culture/rebuilding-companies-as-communities/) article, "organizations function best when committed people work in cooperative relationships based on respect." Ways to improve team cohesion:

* Add colleagues to your [important people list](../personal/use/use-insights.md#add-important-people); also, receive suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from these contacts.
* Provide teams with virtual opportunities to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities such as online games.

For more best practices, see [Best practices for community connectivity](../tutorials/gm-connectivity.md).

## Utilize influencers

Influencers are people within an organization who are well connected and can drive innovation by efficiently sharing information with others.

The [Measuring your employees’ invisible forms of influence](https://insights.office.com/productivity/measuring-your-employees-invisible-forms-of-influence/) article says that "traditional organizational reporting structures limit managers’ visibility into how their employees are influencing and contributing to other teams. New workplace metrics are needed to help leaders get a more complete picture of this." Ways to leverage influencers:

* Use [Insights](../personal/use/use-insights.md) and the [Network](../personal/use/network.md) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections and cultivate influence.
* Use [Microsoft Teams channels](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive conversations.

For more best practices and how to identify and utilize influencers, see [Best practices for influencers](../tutorials/gm-influencer.md).

## Foster connectivity

Managers who have diverse ties across an organization are typically considered more effective and help their employees build strong networks.

In the [Empowering your employees to empower themselves](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/empowering-your-employees-to-empower-themselves/) article: "Your employees understand their jobs. They know their tasks, roles, and functions within the organization, and it’s time for you to let them do what they need to do to get the job done." Ways to foster connectivity:

* Create cross-team communities for people with similar interests to share ideas, knowledge, and resources. This can also be done using [Teams channels](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
* Enable and use the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../personal/use/use-insights.md) and [personal network insights](../personal/use/network.md) to add colleagues to your **Important people** list, receive suggestions to meet, reminders to respond to emails, and complete tasks for these contacts. And urge your team to do the same.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) to strengthen connectivity through channel interactions about projects, strategic topics, and goals to enable information sharing, brainstorming, and team building.

For more best practices and ways to open your network to your team, see [Best practices for manager connectedness](../tutorials/gm-connectedness.md).
