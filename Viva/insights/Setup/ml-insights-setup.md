# Admin tasks for manager and leader insights

Confirm the following [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and then ask your Teams Service Administrator to deploy the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams for you and your team. Because personal, manager, and leader insights require the same admin tasks, see [Admin tasks](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md) for the required steps.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are different for manager insights about your team and leader insights about your organization. Confirm the following prerequisites for the type of insights you want to view.

* **Manager insights** - To get access to **My Team**, confirm you meet the following prerequisites:

  * **Manager access** - Ask if your Viva Insights or Workplace Analytics admin has [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md) in Workplace Analytics turned **On**.
  * **No other roles** - You are not assigned _any other_ roles for Viva Insights in Workplace Analytics, including admin, analyst, or program manager.
  * **Licensed team** - The members of your team are assigned licenses for Viva Insights in Workplace Analytics and are included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager.  
  * **Minimum team size** - Your team structure meets the minimum group size of 10 or more measured and licensed employees (including you as their manager).

* **Leader insights** - To view the **My organization** page in the Viva Insights app in Teams, you need the role of _Analyst (Limited)_ for Viva Insights in Workplace Analytics. See [Assign roles](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md) for detailed instructions and see [Role descriptions and access levels](../use/user-roles.md#role-descriptions-and-access-levels) for general information about roles.

## Install and pin the app

To install and pin the Viva Insights app for yourself, see [Install and pin the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md#install-the-app). However, if you're an admin installing the Viva Insights app for an organization, see [Admin tasks](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md).
