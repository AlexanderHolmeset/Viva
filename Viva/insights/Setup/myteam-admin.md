## Admin tasks for My team

Before licensed users can access the premium features within the Microsoft Viva Insights apps, you’ll need to enable them. The Microsoft Viva Insights SKU includes the following app options in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

* **Microsoft Viva Insights** - Gives access to premium features within personal and manager insights on the Updated My team page in the Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams app.
* **Microsoft Viva Insights (WpA transition)** – Only relevant for those who purchased licenses before October 2021 to use the Workplace Analytics app. If this is the only app that is enabled, this group or individual will continue to have access to the analyst features in Workplace Analytics but will not have access to premium features for personal and manager insights on the My team page in the Viva Insights in Teams app.

>[!Important]
>If your organization purchased Viva Insights licenses starting in October 2021, all the regular and premium features are available within your employees’ personal, team lead, manager, and leader insights in the Viva Insights in Teams app. Enabling or disabling the WpA transition app option will not change their access to Viva Insights in Teams.

If your organization purchased Workplace Analytics before October 2021, you might have accidentally assigned the Microsoft Viva Insights in Teams app to your employees, which enables them to see the premium features in Viva Insights in Teams. To confirm this possibility and to enable or disable access to the app as applicable, do the steps in the following section.
