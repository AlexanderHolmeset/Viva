# Environment requirements

Environment requirements vary depending on the type of insights you are going to view in Microsoft Viva Insights, such as personal insights, manager insights, or leader insights in Microsoft Teams or advanced insights in the web-based service.

## Personal insights

The requirements for personal insights in Microsoft Viva Insights are described in [Plans and environments for personal insights](../personal/overview/plans-environments.md).

## Manager, leader, and advanced insights

With the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses), your company can get manager and leader insights in Teams, and advanced insights features as an add-in to the licensing agreement.

Microsoft Exchange Online provides much of the collaboration data that Viva Insights uses. For this reason, we recommend that you have a Microsoft 365 or an Office 365 product that contains Exchange Online Plan 1 and Plan 2.

## Channel support

Other channels such as Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) do not support the addition of Viva Insights at this time. Also, note the following circumstances for various types of customers:

|  Type  | Notes |  
|---- | ---- |
|Government | Government Community Cloud (GCC) does not currently support the addition of Viva Insights. |
|Education | Supported only for the analysis of faculty at this time, not for students. |
|Commercial | You can add Viva Insights with commercial enrollments. |
|Non-profit | Viva Insights can be used by non-profits but non-profit pricing is not available. |
|Firstline workers | Viva Insights does not support analysis of first-line workers that use Microsoft Firstline Worker SKUs (F1, F3, F5) at this time. |

## Tenant environments

Viva Insights requires the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses) and a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenant with Exchange Online Plan 1, Plan 2, or Kiosk.

## Viva Insights licenses

[Assign licenses](assign-licenses-to-population.md) to the users whose mailboxes you want to analyze. This can mean all the employees in your organization or a specific subset. To ensure statistical significance and meaningful comparative analysis, companies get the most benefit when they deploy Viva Insights to the entire company or to a large group of employees.
