# Assign roles overview

The following describes who does what to assign roles to users of Microsoft Viva Insights (formerly Workplace Analytics):

* **Owner** - Azure Active Directory (AD) [Privileged Role Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator)
* **Task** - Assign users roles for the Viva Insights service.
* **Outcome** - Roles must be assigned before administrators can set system defaults, privacy settings, and upload and verify organizational data in Viva Insights. After data is provisioned, data analysts can sign in and use Viva Insights. Admins also give managers access to their team's data in Viva Insights through [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).

## Roles and access levels

See [User roles](../use/user-roles.md) for detailed role descriptions and access levels.
