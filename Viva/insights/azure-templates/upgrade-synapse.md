# Upgrade to Synapse Analytics

Your current Azure Templates have been using Workplace Analytics data that's been exported and running on Azure Databricks for computations. To improve usability and reduce costs, you can upgrade from Databricks to Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure admin** - Must be an admin of the Azure subscription or you cannot complete the upgrade.
* **SAS token for file download** - You should've received an email from Microsoft with the SAS token for this upgrade. If you did not receive an email with it, ask your Microsoft representative for it.
* **App Registrations access** - Confirm you can access the Azure Active Directory “App Registrations” in the Azure portal for your current Azure Templates installation for both the “UI” and the “API," including the IDs for the services being upgraded.
* **Azure Active Directory Service access** - Confirm you have access in the Azure portal, including the Tenant ID.
* **Resource Groups access** - Confirm you access in the Azure portal, including the names and Subscription IDs.
* **Azure Template service names** - Confirm you have the names of the current Azure Template services in the Azure portal, including the storage account, UI or UX app service, API app service, and the key vault names.
* **Key vault secrets access** – Confirm you can view and modify the Key vault secrets because the scripts must be able to modify some of the key vault secrets. If you don’t have access, the scripts will fail with permission errors.

## Open Azure Cloud Shell

Login to the Azure Portal, and open Azure Cloud Shell as described in [Overview of Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

>[!Note]
>If this is your first time running Azure Cloud Shell, you will need to select the subscription storage before you are allowed to use Cloud Shell.

## Download the scripts

1. To format the **SAS URL** for the download, open Windows Notepad, and then copy and paste the following:

   ```azure-cli
   $sasUri = "https://wpaappsprodtest1.blob.core.windows.net/tmpexternal/AztScripts_20211011.zip"
   ```

   And then add the **SAS Token** between **zip?** and **"** (the closing double quotes), as shown in the following example URL:

   ```“https://wpaappsprodtest1.blob.core.windows.net/tmpexternal/AztScripts_20211011.zip?sv=2020-08-04&ss=bfqt&srt=o&sp=rwdlacupitfx&se=2022-02-22T04:16:23Z&st=2022-02-14T20:16:23Z&spr=https&sig=K6fCajAhRpHPm%2FlTdrTdFc0fXfYHLNDKF4zvbBXYAOE%3D%22”```

1. Copy the full **SAS URL**, including your **SAS Token** (as described in the previous step), paste it in the Cloud Shell command line, and then press **Enter**.
1. In the Cloud Shell command line, run the following to download the Scripts .zip file:

   ```azure-cli
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $sasuri -outfile ./aztScriptsCloudShell.zip
   ```

   >[!Note]
   >If successful, you won't see any output. However, if errors do occur, you'll see them as output.

1. Run the following to unzip the Scripts Archive:

   ```azure-cli
   Expand-Archive -LiteralPath ./aztScriptsCloudShell.zip -DestinationPath ./ -Force
   ```

1. Run ```dir``` to list the directories in the current folder, and confirm that the **AztScripts_20211011** directory is listed:

   ![AztScripts directory example.](images/directory-example.png)

1. To set up the Params file, run the following to copy the **template-all-param.txt** file that you just downloaded and rename it to **azt-param.txt**, which you can then edit to use in the script:

   ```azure-cli
   Copy-Item ./AztScripts_20211011/template-all-param.txt ./AztScripts_20211011/azt-param.txt
   ```

1. Select the **editor** (**{}**) icon to open the [Cloud Shell editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/using-cloud-shell-editor#opening-the-editor), and then open the **azt-param.txt** file.
1. In the left pane, expand the **AztScripts_20211011** file folder, and then locate and open the **azt-param.txt** file.
1. You'll need to enter the parameters that are specific to your environment, as described in the following section before you can complete the upgrade.

## Script parameters

The following describes what you must enter within each section of the **azt-param.txt** file for this upgrade process.

### SQL Server

* **servers_sql_admin**: Does not have to be unique. You can use “wpaaztsqladm” or whatever you prefer.
* **servers_sql_admin_pwd**: Must be 8 to 20 characters in length and include at least one symbol (@#$%&).

### Synapse

* **synapse_workspace**: Must be globally unique. Something on-brand works best because no one else can use this name for their service. The following shows the rules for the name:

   ![Workspace naming rules image.](images/workspace-name.png)

* **synapse_adlsgen**: Must also be globally unique (no one else can use this name for their service), between 3 and 24 characters with only lowercase letters and numbers (no capital letters, special characters, or spaces).

### AAD application registrations

The following are shown in the API’s App Registration in Azure for your current Azure Template setup:

* **aad_api_clientid**: On the **Overview** page as **Application (client) ID**.
* **aad_api_clientname**: Also, at the top left of the **Overview** page, it's shown as the name of the **App Registration**.
* **aad_api_clientid_key**: Within the left navigation, under **Certificates & Secrets**, you'll see a listing of valid (and invalid) keys. However, you can only see the first three characters of the key in this list. The full key is only shown when it is created. You'll need to ask your Azure admin for the full key or ask for a new one.

The following is shown in the App Registration UI in Azure for your current Azure Templates setup"

* **aad_ui_clientid**: Shown on the Overview page as **Application (client) ID**.

### Dest storage

>[!Important]
>Please save the **azt-param.txt** file after entering the required parameters described in this section.

## Run the script

After you've entered the correct parameters in the **azt-param.txt** file, you can run the script.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following to open the folder:

   ```azure-cli
   cd ./AztScripts_20211011
   ```

1. Run the following to create the Synapse workspace with permissions and a Spark pool cluster, which then links a Gen2 storage account to them:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapseworkspaceandlinkage.ps1
   ```

1. Run the following to add the packages (Requirements7.txt) to the Spark pool cluster and link to the Blob storage:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsepackage.ps1
   ```

1. Run the following to update the existing SQL environment:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsesql-code.ps1
   ```

1. Run the following to import the Integration dataset: 

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapseintegrationdataset.ps1
   ```

1. After the ONA job successfully completes, it zips it into **ONA_Results_zip**, and then the  **ONA_Results_pipeline** is created. Now run the following to import the Notebooks from the storage account into the Synapse workspace:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsenotebookcreation-code.ps1
   ```

1. Run the following to create the Pipelines based on JSON script, and then import them into Synapse workspace:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsepipelinecreation.ps1
   ```

1. The Pipelines are based off the kind of job being completed, such as Organizational Network Analysis or Relationship Intelligence. Now run the following to add the Key Vault Secrets for the Synapse workspace:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsekeyvault.ps1
   ```

1. Run the following to add permissions to the Storage account:

   ```azure-cli
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```

1. Then run the following to add permissions to access the storage account from the Synapse workspace:

   ```azure-cli
   ./2m-azuresynapsepermissions.ps1
   ```

   >[!Note]
   >During this step, you can ignore the warnings about “InvalidOperation: Expression after ‘&’” and “InvalidOperation: Cannot index into null array."

## Deploying the UI and API

Run the following in Cloud Shell, which uses Zip Deploy to install the build for the web app on the server:

```azure-cli
./2e-appservice-code.ps1
```

After completing this upgrade process, the API will now facilitate calls only to Azure Synapse pipelines, which is consistent with the current Synapse solution.
