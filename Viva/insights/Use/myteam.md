# My team insights

Microsoft Viva Insights shows team managers and leads insights about their teams’ work patterns. Get visibility into leading indicators of overall team experience and wellbeing. You can then use these insights to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change.

You can access team insights in **My team** within the Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams.

## Data privacy

When data is processed for team insights, Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the same as for Personal insights. For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in Viva Insights, see [Privacy guide](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-privacy.md).  

## Install, pin, and configure the app

After your admin has completed the [Admin tasks](../setup/ml-insights-setup.md), the setup for **My team** is the same as for [Personal insights](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app.md) in the Viva Insights app. See the following to install, pin, and configure the app in Teams:

* [Install and pin the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md)
* [Configure the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-settings.md)

## View My team

1. In the left navigation bar in Teams, select **Insights**.
2. In **Viva Insights Home**, you’ll see an insight about your team. To learn more about this insight, select **Explore more**.

   ![Insights Home page.](../images/wpa/use/home-mgr.png)

   You can also use any of the other features on this page, such as **Reflect**, **Praise**, **Stay connected**, and **Protect time**. For more information, see [Viva Insights Home](/insights/viva-insights-home).

3. In Viva Insights, select **My team** to see key recommendations, actions, and reflections relating to your team.

## Manage your team

As a team manager, lead, or even as a team member, you can create a team and view insights about them. With the exception of [Group insights](#group-insights), the team insights you can see are based on data that's processed from within your own mailbox for only you to see. The first time you open **My team**, Viva Insights prompts you to select or confirm your current team members that you want to include in your team insights.

After this initial setup, you can add and remove team members at any time by selecting **Go to settings** in the **Your team** section.

## Recommendations and actions

Each day, you'll see a new recommendation at the top of your **My team** page. You'll also see options to stay connected and send praise in the **Actions for you** section.

In **Reflect**, you might see one or more suggestions to improve your own personal habits as a team member. For example, if you select **Explore more** in **Your habits**, you'll see more details about who you collaborated with. It might also suggest you reconnect with members who you haven't collaborated with lately.

You might also see suggestions for your team in the **Plans** section. For example, if you select **Get started** for **Schedule a no-meeting day for your team**, you're prompted to get started creating a plan that schedules a shared recurring time that everyone in your team can use to focus without interruptions.

## Group insights

Group insights are only available to qualifying managers who are assigned the manager role and meet the minimum-group requirements. See [Admin tasks](../setup/ml-insights-setup.md) for details.

As a qualified manager, the **Group insights** section in **My team** shows a top insight about your team based on collaboration data. You can select **Explore more** to see more in-depth data about your team's employee experience and effectiveness. See [Explore group insights](myteam-explore.md) for details.
