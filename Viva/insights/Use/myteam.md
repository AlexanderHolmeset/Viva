# My team insights

Microsoft Viva Insights shows team managers and leads insights about their teams’ work patterns. Get visibility into leading indicators of overall team experience, wellbeing, and productivity. You can then use these insights to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change.

You can access team insights in **My team** within the Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams if have team members assigned to you in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Data privacy

All of the information shown on this page is derived from a manager's personal Exchange Online mailbox. Managers do not see any incremental information from team members' mailboxes that would allow them to track team member activities. For example, a manager can use this page to see if they've sent an email to a team member after hours, but they cannot determine whether the team member opened the email.

When data is processed for team insights, Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the same as for personal insights. For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in Viva Insights, see [Privacy guide](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-privacy.md).  

## Install, pin, and configure the app

After your admin has completed the [Admin tasks](../setup/ml-insights-setup.md), the setup for **My team** is the same as for [Personal insights](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app.md) in the Viva Insights app. See the following to install, pin, and configure the app in Teams:

* [Install and pin the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md)
* [Configure the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-settings.md)

## View My team

   ![Insights Home page.](../images/wpa/use/home-mgr.png)

   You can also use any of the other features on this page, such as **Reflect**, **Praise**, **Stay connected**, and **Protect time**. For more information, see [Viva Insights Home](/insights/viva-insights-home).

3. In Viva Insights, select **My team** to see key recommendations, actions, and reflections relating to your team.

## Manage your team

If you are a team manager, lead, or even a team member who has a team of five or more assigned to you in Active AD, you can create a team and view insights about them within the Viva Insights app. With the exception of [Group insights](#group-insights), the team insights you see are based on data that's processed from within your own mailbox for only you to see.

The first time you open **My team**, you are prompted to select or confirm your current team members. The initial list of team members you see is derived from Azure AD. After this initial setup, you can add and remove team members at any time by selecting **Go to settings** in the **Your team** section.

## Recommendations and actions

Each day, you'll see a new recommendation at the top of your **My team** page. You'll also see options to stay connected and send praise in the **Actions for you** section.

In **Reflect**, you might see one or more suggestions to improve your own personal habits as a team member. For example, if you select **Explore more** in [Your habits](#your-habits), you'll see more details about who you collaborated with. It might also suggest you reconnect with members who you haven't collaborated with lately.

You might also see suggestions for your team in the **Plans** section. For example, if you select **Get started** for **Schedule a no-meeting day for your team**, you're prompted to get started creating a plan that schedules a shared recurring time that everyone in your team can use to focus without interruptions.

### Your habits

As a manager, you often have a hectic schedule, and it can be tough to stay in close contact with each team member. Viva Insights brings together all the information you need to stay caught up and respond quickly to important requests.

As a manager, you can:

* Schedule 1:1 time with a team member (or reschedule if a conflict comes up)
* Act on tasks you promised to get done or that team members asked you to complete
* Review important emails and documents from team members that you haven’t read yet

## Leadership insights

See [Leadership insights](../personal/use/leadership.md#leadership-insights) for more details about how best to use 1:1 time with your team members, how quiet hours can impact wellbeing, and how meeting habits can impact you and your team's productivity.

## Group insights

Group insights are only available to qualifying managers who are assigned the manager role and meet the minimum-group requirements. See [Admin tasks](../setup/ml-insights-setup.md) for details.

As a qualified manager, the **Group insights** section in **My team** shows a top insight about your team based on collaboration data. You can select **Explore more** to see more in-depth data about your team's employee experience and effectiveness. See [Explore group insights](myteam-explore.md) for details.
