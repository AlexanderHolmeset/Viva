# Group insights within My team

As a qualifying people manager, Microsoft Viva Insights gives you much-needed visibility into leading indicators of your overall team experience, wellbeing, and productivity. You can use these insights to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change.

The **Group insights** section within **My team** is only available to qualified managers. For details, see [Admin tasks](#admin-tasks).

## Data privacy

When data is processed for group insights, Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the same as for personal insights. For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in Viva Insights, see [Privacy guide](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-privacy.md).

## Admin tasks

To see **Group insights** in **My team**, confirm the following prerequisites for your team:

* **Manager access** - Ask your admin if [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md) are turned **On** and you are not signed in or assigned _any other_ roles for Viva Insights in Workplace Analytics.
* **Licensed team** - The members of your team are assigned [Viva Insights licenses](../setup/environment-requirements.md#viva-insights-licenses) with the [MyAnalytics (Full) service plan](../personal/overview/plans-environments.md) and are included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager.
* **Minimum team size** - Your team structure meets the minimum group size of 10 or more measured and licensed employees (including you as their manager).
* **Set up the app** - Ask your admin to install and set up the Viva Insights app in Teams for your organization. See [Admin tasks](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md) for details.
