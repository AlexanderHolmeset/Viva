# Manager insights

Microsoft Viva Insights shows managers insights about their teams’ work patterns that might lead to burnout and stress. These can be caused by regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time.

As a manager, you can see these insights in **My team** within the Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams. My team provides visibility into team collaboration patterns that are leading indicators of overall employee experience and wellbeing. You can then use these insights to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change.
