# Leader and manager settings

As an admin for Microsoft Viva Insights or Workplace Analytics, you can use **Leader & manager settings** to configure the following.

* **Privacy settings** - This applies exclusively to the outcome data that leaders see in the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams. Use the **Tenant minimum group size** setting to set the minimum number of people in a group, which must be at least five, before leaders can see any data relating to their teams in **My organization**.
* **Manager settings** - Enable all or specific people managers to see team insights in Workplace Analytics. For details, see [Manager settings](manager-settings.md).

**Owner** â€“ Only Viva Insights and Workplace Analytics Admins can access these settings. For details, see [Assign roles](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).
