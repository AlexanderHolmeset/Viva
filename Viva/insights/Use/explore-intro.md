* [**Internal networks**](../use/explore-metrics-internal-networks.md) shows network connections between different people within a company.
* [**External collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration.md) summarizes employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](../use/explore-metrics-teams.md) shows communication trends about how your employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

## Access to Explore the stats

You can access Explore the stats data through the recommendations within **See your insights** in the [**Take action**](insights.md#take-action) section of a relevant behavior.

## Data time limit

The historical data that populates **Explore the stats** is time limited; the charts reflect data that is no older than six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Microsoft 365 data](../use/office-365-data.md) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data reflected in **Explore the stats** advances by one week.
