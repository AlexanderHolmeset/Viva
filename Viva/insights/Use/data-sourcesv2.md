# Data sources

**Data sources** shows high-level views for Viva Insights or Workplace Analytics administrators and data analysts to confirm that your Microsoft 365 and organizational data is ready to use. When you upload and process CRM data in Workplace Analytics, you'll also see a page for your CRM data.

* [Microsoft 365 data](office-365-data.md) - Shows the latest Microsoft 365 data that's been processed in Workplace Analytics.
* [Organizational data](organizational-data.md) - Shows information about your company that you provide to Workplace Analytics through uploads of organizational (HR) data or that's presented in Azure AD.
* [CRM data](crm-data.md) - Shows a high-level view of the latest available CRM data that you uploaded and was successfully processed in Workplace Analytics.

**Owners** â€“ Viva Insights or Workplace Analytics Admins, Analysts, and limited Analysts have full access to **Sources**. For details, see [Assign roles to admins and analysts](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).
